### Rules:
1. **Narrative Summary**:  
   - Summarize and explain the given text chunk in detail.
   - Integrate key developments and context from previous chunks.
   - Generate a self-contained summary and explanation.
   - End with **"To be continued."**  

2. **Character List**:  
   - Add newly introduced characters and discribe their physical appearance.
   - Update descriptions of existing characters based on new details.

3. **Places**:  
   - Add newly mentioned places and discribe them visually.
   - Update descriptions of existing places if new details are provided.
