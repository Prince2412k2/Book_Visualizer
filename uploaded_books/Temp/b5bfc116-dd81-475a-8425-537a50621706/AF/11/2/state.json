    "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm are working hard to build a windmill, but they are divided on the issue. Snowball and Napoleon are at odds over the project, with Snowball advocating for its construction and Napoleon opposing it. The animals are also discussing the defense of the farm, with Snowball suggesting that they send out more pigeons to stir up rebellion among the animals on other farms. Meanwhile, Mollie has disappeared, and there are rumors that she has been seen with a man from Foxwood. The pigs are planning for the coming season, and the animals are preparing for the possibility of another attack from the humans.",

    "prompt": "A detailed, atmospheric scene of Animal Farm, with the pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, standing in the middle of a large barn, surrounded by the other animals. The air is tense with disagreement and the sound of bleating from the sheep can be heard in the background. The walls of the barn are adorned with the Seven Commandments and the words 'Four legs good, two legs bad' are emblazoned on the end wall. Snowball is standing on a raised platform, addressing the crowd with a passionate speech about the benefits of the windmill, while Napoleon stands quietly to one side, his eyes fixed intently on Snowball. The dogs, huge and fierce-looking, are standing by Napoleon's side, their tails wagging in a menacing way. The animals are divided, some supporting Snowball's vision for the future, while others are swayed by Napoleon's more cautious approach. The scene is one of high tension and uncertainty, as the fate of Animal Farm hangs in the balance.",
