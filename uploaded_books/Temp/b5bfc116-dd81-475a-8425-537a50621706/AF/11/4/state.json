    "prompt": "A haunting and atmospheric scene depicting the animals of Animal Farm, once united in their rebellion against the humans, now divided and oppressed by the pigs' tyrannical rule. The windmill, a symbol of their hard-won freedom, lies in ruins, destroyed by the very enemy they had once defeated. The animals, weary and wounded, gather around the site of the windmill, their faces etched with a mix of grief, anger, and despair. In the background, the farmhouse looms, its windows glowing with an otherworldly light, as if the pigs are reveling in their newfound power. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and blood, and the sound of distant gunfire echoes through the landscape. In the foreground, Boxer, the loyal and dedicated workhorse, stands tall, his eyes fixed on the ruins of the windmill, his heart heavy with the knowledge that their labor has been destroyed. The scene is bathed in a golden, sunset light, casting long shadows across the landscape, and emphasizing the sense of loss and betrayal that has consumed the animals. In the distance, the silhouette of a figure, possibly Napoleon, can be seen, watching the animals with an air of superiority, as if he is savoring their misery. The overall mood is one of desolation and hopelessness, as the animals struggle to come to terms with the destruction of their dreams and the betrayal of their leaders.",
