    "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm worked hard to build the windmill, but it was destroyed by Snowball. Napoleon blamed Snowball for the destruction and announced that he would be punished. The animals were shocked and began to rebuild the windmill. However, they faced many challenges, including a lack of food and a harsh winter. Napoleon decided to sell some of the farm's products to obtain more grain, but the hens protested and were punished. Meanwhile, Snowball was accused of being a traitor and selling himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm. The animals were convinced of Snowball's guilt, but Boxer was still unsure. The story highlights the corrupting influence of power and the dangers of blindly following a leader.",
