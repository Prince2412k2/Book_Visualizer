    "prompt": "A dramatic and vibrant illustration of a sunlit farmyard on a summer morning, with a group of animals gathered around a large barn. The animals are of various species, including pigs, horses, cows, sheep, and chickens, all with unique expressions and postures. In the center of the group, a majestic pig stands on a raised platform, addressing the others with a passionate speech. The background of the barn is adorned with a lantern, and the walls are made of rough-hewn wood. The atmosphere is one of excitement and anticipation, as the animals listen intently to the pig's words. In the foreground, a few animals are shown with their mouths open, as if they are singing along to a rousing chorus. The overall mood is one of hope and rebellion, as the animals prepare to take control of their own destiny. The color palette is warm and earthy, with shades of golden brown, green, and blue, evoking a sense of freedom and possibility. The style is reminiscent of a classic children's book illustration, with bold lines and vibrant colors. The composition is dynamic and engaging, with the animals' bodies and faces forming a sense of movement and energy.",
