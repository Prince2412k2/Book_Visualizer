    "prompt": "A serene, moonlit night on a rural farm, with a majestic barn in the center. The barn's door is slightly ajar, casting a warm, golden light onto the surrounding grass. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the soft chirping of crickets. In the distance, a group of animals, including pigs, horses, cows, and sheep, are gathered around a makeshift platform, listening intently to a wise old boar, Old Major, as he delivers a passionate speech about the importance of unity, equality, and the overthrow of their human oppressors. The animals are all dressed in their natural coats, with some wearing subtle, earthy tones, while others have vibrant, colorful markings. The atmosphere is one of anticipation, hope, and determination. In the background, a faint, flickering light can be seen, casting an eerie glow onto the surrounding landscape. As the animals listen to Old Major's words, they begin to sing a stirring, anthemic song, 'Beasts of England', their voices rising and falling in perfect harmony. The scene is a powerful, emotional, and visually stunning representation of the animals' desire for freedom and equality.",
