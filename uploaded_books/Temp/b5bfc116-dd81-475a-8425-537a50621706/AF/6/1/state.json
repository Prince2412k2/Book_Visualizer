    "summary": "The animals on Manor Farm, led by the pigs, have successfully overthrown Mr. Jones and taken control of the farm. They have renamed the farm Animal Farm and have established a new system of government based on the principles of Animalism. The pigs, led by Snowball and Napoleon, have taken on the roles of leaders and have begun to implement the Seven Commandments, which include the abolition of human rule and the establishment of equality among all animals. The animals have worked together to harvest the hay, with the pigs directing and supervising the others. The harvest was a huge success, and the animals are now enjoying the fruits of their labor. However, there are already signs of trouble, as the pigs begin to take on more and more power and the other animals start to feel left out.",

    "scene_title": "The Animals' Rebellion on Manor Farm",
    "prompt": "A dramatic and detailed scene of a group of animals, led by pigs, cows, horses, and other farm animals, rising up against their human oppressors on a rural farm. The animals, inspired by the words of a wise old boar named Major, have been secretly planning a rebellion for months. They are determined to take control of the farm and create a new society where all animals are equal. The scene opens on a sunny summer day, with the animals gathered in the big barn, listening to Major's speech. The animals are shown to be a diverse group, with different breeds and personalities, but they are united in their desire for freedom and equality. As Major speaks, the animals are shown to be deeply moved, and they begin to sing a rousing song, 'Beasts of England'. The scene then cuts to the animals' successful rebellion against the humans, with the animals chasing the humans off the farm and taking control. The animals are shown to be jubilant, with some of them dancing and singing, while others are shown to be more subdued, reflecting on the significance of their victory. The scene ends with the animals gathered around the farmhouse, looking at the Seven Commandments, which have been painted on the wall. The Commandments are a set of principles that the animals have created to guide their new society, and they are shown to be a key part of the animals' vision for a better future.",
