    "scene_title": "The Animals' Rebellion on Manor Farm",
    "prompt": "A dark and stormy night on Manor Farm, the animals are gathered in the big barn, listening to Old Major, a wise and aged boar, deliver a passionate speech about the need for rebellion against the tyrannical Mr. Jones. The animals are deeply moved by his words and begin to sing the iconic song 'Beasts of England'. As the night wears on, the animals become increasingly restless, and the tension builds. Suddenly, a group of rats scurries out of their hiding places, and the dogs give chase. Major raises his voice, calling for silence, and the animals settle down once more. He proposes a vote on whether rats are comrades or enemies, and the majority vote in favor of their inclusion. The animals then discuss the principles of Animalism, a system of thought that emphasizes the importance of unity and equality among all animals. The pigs, led by Snowball and Napoleon, take on the role of teachers and organizers, helping the other animals to understand and adopt the principles of Animalism. Meanwhile, Moses, the tame raven, spreads rumors and lies, trying to undermine the animals' confidence in their new way of life. As the days pass, the animals become more and more committed to their cause, and they begin to see the benefits of their new way of life. They work together to harvest the hay, using their unique skills and abilities to overcome the challenges they face. The pigs, with their intelligence and resourcefulness, take on the role of leaders, directing the other animals and ensuring that the harvest is a success. As the harvest is completed, the animals gather to celebrate their hard work and their newfound freedom. They are filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment, and they know that they have created a better life for themselves. The scene is set on a sunny summer day, with the animals gathered in the fields, enjoying the fruits of their labor. The atmosphere is one of joy and contentment, as the animals bask in the knowledge that they are now the masters of their own destiny.",
