    "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm are shocked and terrified by the executions of their comrades, who had confessed to crimes against the farm. The animals are also dismayed by the cruel retribution they have witnessed. Boxer, a loyal and hardworking horse, suggests that the solution to the problems on the farm is to work harder. The animals work even harder than before, but they are not rewarded with better food or living conditions. Instead, they are forced to work longer hours and are subjected to the whims of the pigs, who have become increasingly tyrannical. The pigs, led by Napoleon, have become corrupt and power-hungry, and they use their position to exploit and oppress the other animals. The animals are also shocked by the news that the Sixth Commandment, which prohibits the killing of animals without cause, has been altered to allow for the execution of traitors. The animals are forced to work even harder to rebuild the windmill, which has been destroyed by the enemy. The windmill is eventually completed, but the animals are shocked to learn that Napoleon has sold the timber to Frederick, the enemy, for a paltry sum. The animals are also dismayed by the news that the banknotes used to pay for the timber were forgeries. The animals are forced to fight a fierce battle against the enemy, who have destroyed the windmill and are threatening to attack the farm again. The animals emerge victorious, but they are weary and bleeding. The pigs, led by Napoleon, declare a victory and celebrate with a feast. However, the animals are not fooled and are aware that the pigs are using their power to exploit and oppress them. The pigs also introduce the drinking of alcohol, which is punished by death. The animals are shocked by this news and are aware that the pigs are becoming increasingly tyrannical. The pigs also introduce the concept of the Order of the Green Banner, which is a new decoration that is awarded to those who have served the farm well. The animals are also shocked by the news that Napoleon is ill and is being treated with special care. However, it is soon revealed that Napoleon is not ill, but is instead using his position to exploit and oppress the other animals.

    "prompt": "A haunting, desolate landscape of a once-thriving farm, now scarred by the remnants of a brutal battle. The windmill, once a symbol of hope and progress, lies in ruins, its walls shattered and its sails torn asunder. The animals, weary and wounded, huddle together in fear and uncertainty. In the distance, the farmhouse looms, its windows dark and foreboding. The air is heavy with the stench of blood and smoke, and the only sound is the distant rumble of thunder. In the foreground, a lone figure, Boxer, stands tall, his eyes fixed on the horizon, his heart heavy with the weight of his own mortality. His fur is matted and dirty, his coat is torn, and his eyes are sunken. He is a testament to the enduring spirit of the animals, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. The sky above is a deep, foreboding grey, with clouds that seem to stretch on forever. The wind is picking up, and the trees sway ominously in the breeze. In the background, the silhouette of a figure, Napoleon, stands watch, his eyes fixed on the horizon, his heart filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. But as the light begins to fade, and the shadows grow long, it becomes clear that this is not a victory, but a defeat. The animals are not free, they are not equal, and they are not safe. They are trapped in a never-ending cycle of fear and oppression, and the only way out is through the darkness of their own despair.",
