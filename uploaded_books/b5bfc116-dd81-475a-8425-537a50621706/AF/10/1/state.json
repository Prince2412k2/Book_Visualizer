    "prompt": "A dramatic and vibrant scene depicting the animals' rebellion on Manor Farm, with a focus on the emotions and actions of the animals as they take control of the farm. The scene should capture the excitement and sense of freedom as the animals work together to harvest the hay and establish a new way of life. The lighting should be warm and golden, with the sun shining down on the animals as they labor in the fields. The atmosphere should be one of joy and camaraderie, with the animals working together in harmony. In the background, the farmhouse should be visible, with the pigs and other animals gathered around the Seven Commandments, which should be written in bold, white letters on the wall. The scene should also include the milk buckets, which should be empty, symbolizing the pigs' decision to keep the milk for themselves. The overall mood should be one of hope and optimism, as the animals look to the future and their new way of life.",
