    "prompt": "A dimly lit barn on a misty summer evening, the air thick with the scent of hay and damp earth. The animals of Manor Farm, once oppressed by the tyrannical Mr. Jones, gather around Old Major, a wise and aged boar, as he delivers a passionate speech about the need for rebellion against their human overlords. The animals listen intently, their eyes shining with a mix of excitement and fear, as Old Major outlines the principles of Animalism and the importance of unity and solidarity in the struggle for freedom. The scene is set against a backdrop of rustic farm buildings, with the sound of crickets and the distant lowing of cows providing a soothing melody. The lighting is warm and golden, with the only source of light coming from a lantern hung from a beam in the barn. The atmosphere is one of anticipation and hope, as the animals begin to realize that they have the power to create a better future for themselves. In the foreground, Old Major stands on a raised platform, his voice ringing out across the barn as he speaks of the golden future time, when the animals will be free from the tyranny of humans and live in a world of plenty and equality. The animals are a diverse group, with pigs, horses, cows, sheep, and even a few rats and dogs in attendance. They are all dressed in their finest attire, with the pigs sporting smart coats and the horses adorned with ribbons in their manes. The scene is a powerful tribute to the struggle for freedom and the importance of standing up against oppression, and is set against a backdrop of rolling hills and green pastures, with the sun setting over the horizon in the distance.",
