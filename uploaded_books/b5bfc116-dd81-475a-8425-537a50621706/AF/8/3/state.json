    "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm have been working hard to build a windmill, but their progress has been hindered by various setbacks. Despite these challenges, they remain committed to their goal and are determined to rebuild the windmill after it was destroyed by Snowball. Napoleon, the leader of the animals, has announced that they will begin rebuilding the windmill immediately and will work through the winter, rain or shine. The animals are shocked and outraged by Snowball's actions, and a reward has been offered for his capture. Meanwhile, the pigs have moved into the farmhouse and are enjoying the comforts of the human's home. The animals are beginning to feel uneasy about the pigs' new lifestyle and are starting to question the leadership of Napoleon.",
