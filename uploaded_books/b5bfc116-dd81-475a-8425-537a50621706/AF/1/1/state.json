    "prompt": "A serene, golden-hued farm landscape at dawn, with rolling hills and lush green pastures stretching towards the horizon. A rustic, weathered farmhouse stands in the distance, its wooden facade worn from years of exposure to the elements. The sky above is a kaleidoscope of warm colors, transitioning from deep blues and purples to vibrant oranges and pinks. A gentle mist rises from the earth, casting a mystical aura over the scene. In the foreground, a wooden fence, overgrown with vines and wildflowers, adds a touch of whimsy to the composition. The atmosphere is peaceful, with a sense of hope and renewal in the air.",
