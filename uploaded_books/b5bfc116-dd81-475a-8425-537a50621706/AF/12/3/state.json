  "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm are working hard to rebuild the windmill, but they are facing many challenges, including a lack of food and a harsh winter. Napoleon, the leader of the farm, is using propaganda to convince the animals that Snowball, a former leader, is responsible for the windmill's destruction and is secretly working with the neighboring farms to attack them. The animals are beginning to doubt Snowball's innocence and are becoming more and more fearful of him. Meanwhile, the pigs are moving into the farmhouse and taking up residence there, and the hens are being forced to give up their eggs to the pigs. The situation on the farm is becoming increasingly tense and oppressive.",

  "prompt": "A desolate winter scene on Animal Farm, with the windmill in ruins, its walls scattered across the landscape. The once-thriving farm is now a barren and unforgiving place, with snowdrifts covering the ground and the animals huddled together for warmth. In the distance, the farmhouse stands as a symbol of the pigs' increasing power and corruption. The animals, once united in their struggle for freedom, are now divided and struggling to survive. The atmosphere is one of desperation and despair, with the wind howling through the empty fields and the animals' hopes and dreams slowly fading away. In the foreground, a group of animals, led by Boxer and Clover, toil in the snow, their breath visible in the cold air as they struggle to rebuild the windmill. The scene is bathed in a cold, harsh light, with the only warmth coming from the animals' determination to survive and rebuild their shattered lives.",
