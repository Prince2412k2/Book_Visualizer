  "prompt": "A serene and idyllic English countryside setting at dawn, with the Manor Farm in the background. The farm is now called Animal Farm, with the words 'Animal Farm' painted in bold white letters on the five-barred gate. The animals are gathered in the farmyard, their faces filled with excitement and joy. In the foreground, a majestic horse, Boxer, is standing proudly, his muscles rippling beneath his coat. Nearby, a group of pigs, led by Snowball and Napoleon, are directing the other animals as they begin their day's work. The sun is rising over the horizon, casting a warm golden light over the scene. In the distance, the trees are swaying gently in the breeze, and the air is filled with the sweet songs of birds. The atmosphere is one of hope, freedom, and unity, as the animals celebrate their newfound independence and the start of a new era on Animal Farm.",
