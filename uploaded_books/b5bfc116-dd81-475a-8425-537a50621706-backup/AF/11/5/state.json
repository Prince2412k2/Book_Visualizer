  "summary": "Boxer, a loyal and hardworking horse, fell ill and was taken away by the pigs, who claimed he was being sent to a hospital. However, it was later revealed that Boxer was actually taken to a slaughterhouse, where he was killed for his meat. The pigs, led by Napoleon, covered up the truth and told the other animals that Boxer had died in the hospital. The animals were devastated by Boxer's death and felt betrayed by the pigs. The pigs held a memorial banquet in Boxer's honour, but it was clear that they were more interested in celebrating their own power and control over the farm than in paying tribute to Boxer's memory.",

  "prompt": "A poignant and haunting image of Boxer, a worn-out and exhausted horse, lying on his side in a field, his eyes glazed over, his sides matted with sweat, and a thin stream of blood trickling out of his mouth. In the background, the windmill stands tall, a symbol of the farm's progress and Boxer's dedication. The sun casts a warm, golden light on the scene, but the atmosphere is somber and melancholic. The other animals, including Clover and Benjamin, are gathered around Boxer, their faces filled with worry and concern. In the distance, the farmhouse and the orchard can be seen, with the pigs and dogs going about their daily activities, oblivious to the tragedy unfolding before them. The image should evoke a sense of sadness, loss, and the corrupting influence of power, as Boxer's sacrifice is exploited by the pigs to further their own interests.",
