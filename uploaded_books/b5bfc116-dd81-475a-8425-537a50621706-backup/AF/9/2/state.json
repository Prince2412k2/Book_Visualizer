  "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm have been working hard to build a utopian society. Snowball and Napoleon are at odds over the windmill project, with Snowball advocating for its construction and Napoleon opposing it. The animals are divided, with some supporting Snowball's vision of a modernized farm and others backing Napoleon's emphasis on food production. Meanwhile, Mollie has gone missing, and rumors suggest she may have been seen with a man from Foxwood. The pigs are in charge of making decisions, but their disagreements are causing tension. The windmill project is a central issue, with Snowball's plans for a dynamo and electrical power sparking debate. Napoleon's dogs, who have been secretly trained, attack Snowball, and he is forced to flee. The animals are shocked and frightened, and Napoleon announces that the Sunday-morning Meetings will come to an end, with decisions made by a special committee of pigs.",
