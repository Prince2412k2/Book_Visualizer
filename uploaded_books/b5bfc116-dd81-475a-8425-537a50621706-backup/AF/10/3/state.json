  "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm are working hard to build the windmill, but they are facing many challenges. The weather is bad, and they are struggling to collect enough stone. They are also facing a food shortage, and Napoleon has decided to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop to obtain the necessary materials. The animals are uneasy about this decision, as it goes against their original resolutions. Meanwhile, Snowball is accused of destroying the windmill, and Napoleon declares his death sentence. The animals are shocked and begin to rebuild the windmill. However, they are struggling to make progress due to the bad weather and lack of resources. Napoleon is using Mr. Whymper to spread a false impression that the farm is prospering, and the animals are unaware of the true situation. The hens are forced to surrender their eggs, and nine of them die in the process. Snowball is accused of being in league with Jones and plotting to attack the farm. The animals are stunned by this revelation, and Boxer is unsure if he believes it. Squealer explains that Snowball was trying to lure them to their doom at the Battle of the Cowshed, and Comrade Napoleon saved the day. The animals are now more fearful than ever, and Napoleon's power is growing.",

  "prompt": "A desolate, snow-covered farm with a half-built windmill in the background, surrounded by a group of animals, including pigs, horses, cows, and sheep, all working together in a state of drudgery and fear. In the foreground, a group of pigs, led by Napoleon, are gathered around a table, discussing their plans for the farm, while a sly-looking solicitor, Mr. Whymper, looks on. The atmosphere is one of oppression, with the pigs using their power to control and manipulate the other animals. The sky is a deep, foreboding grey, with snowflakes gently falling from above, adding to the sense of desolation and hopelessness. In the distance, a group of animals can be seen working in the fields, their faces gaunt and exhausted, as they toil under the harsh conditions. The overall mood is one of despair and resignation, as the animals struggle to survive under the tyrannical rule of Napoleon and his followers.",
