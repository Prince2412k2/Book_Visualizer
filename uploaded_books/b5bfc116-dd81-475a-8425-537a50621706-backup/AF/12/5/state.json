  "summary": "The chapter begins with Boxer's hoof troubling him a great deal. Clover treats his hoof with poultices of herbs, but Boxer refuses to listen to her advice. He is determined to work hard and finish the windmill before he reaches retirement age. Meanwhile, life on the farm is hard, and food is scarce. The animals are forced to reduce their rations, and the pigs seem to be getting more comfortable. The chapter also introduces the concept of the Spontaneous Demonstration, a weekly celebration of the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. The animals are reminded that they are their own masters and that the work they do is for their own benefit. However, the chapter also highlights the growing inequality between the pigs and the other animals. The pigs are getting more comfortable, while the others are struggling to survive. The chapter ends with the announcement that Animal Farm is to be proclaimed a Republic, and Napoleon is elected unanimously as the President. The chapter also introduces the concept of Sugarcandy Mountain, a mythical place where animals will rest from their labours. The chapter ends with the death of Boxer, who is taken away by the pigs and killed at the knacker's yard. The chapter also introduces the concept of the windmill, which is being built to generate electricity. However, the chapter also highlights the growing corruption and inequality on the farm. The pigs are getting more comfortable, while the others are struggling to survive. The chapter ends with the announcement that the farm is to be enlarged by two fields, which have been bought from Mr. Pilkington. The chapter also introduces the concept of the Seven Commandments, which are being rewritten to reflect the growing inequality on the farm. The chapter ends with the pigs walking on their hind legs, and the animals are shocked and terrified. The chapter also introduces the concept of the wireless set, which is being installed on the farm. The chapter ends with the pigs taking Mr. Jones' clothes out of the wardrobes and putting them on, and Napoleon appearing in a black coat and ratcatcher breeches. The chapter ends with the animals being shown around the farm by the pigs, and they are impressed by the windmill and the other improvements. However, the chapter also highlights the growing corruption and inequality on the farm. The pigs are getting more comfortable, while the others are struggling to survive. The chapter ends with the animals being stricken with curiosity and creeping into the farmhouse garden to see what is happening. They see the pigs and the farmers drinking and laughing together, and they are shocked and terrified. The chapter ends with the animals being forced to accept the growing inequality on the farm, and they are reminded that some animals are more equal than others. To be continued.",
