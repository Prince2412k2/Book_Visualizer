  "prompt": "A serene, moonlit farm scene with a weathered wooden barn in the background, surrounded by rolling hills and lush green pastures. In the foreground, a group of farm animals, including pigs, horses, and cows, are gathered around a makeshift table, engaged in a heated discussion, with a large, old oak tree looming in the background. The atmosphere is tense, with a sense of rebellion and social commentary hanging in the air. The color palette is muted, with shades of green, brown, and gray dominating the scene. The lighting is soft and diffused, with the moon casting a silver glow over the entire scene. In the distance, the silhouette of a university library can be seen, a reminder of the intellectual and literary pursuits that have inspired this gathering of animals. The overall mood is one of contemplation and introspection, as the animals grapple with the complexities of power, corruption, and the human condition.",
