  "summary": "The animals on Animal Farm are divided over the windmill project, with Snowball advocating for its construction and Napoleon opposing it. Snowball's plans for the windmill are elaborate and include the use of electricity to power various machines. However, Napoleon argues that the windmill is a waste of time and that the animals should focus on increasing food production. The animals are eventually swayed by Snowball's eloquence and vote in favor of the windmill. However, just as the vote is about to be finalized, Napoleon's dogs attack Snowball, and he is forced to flee. The animals are left in shock and dismay, and Napoleon announces that the Sunday-morning Meetings will come to an end and that all decisions will be made by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself.",
