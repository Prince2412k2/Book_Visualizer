He reminisces about his childhood, specifically when he was six years old and drew a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant, but the grown-ups did not understand it and thought it was a hat. The narrator was discouraged and abandoned his dream of becoming a painter, instead learning to fly planes and traveling the world. However, he was disappointed by the lack of understanding from the grown-ups he met, who only saw his drawing as a hat. The narrator lived a solitary life until he had a breakdown in the Sahara desert six years ago, where he was stranded with no one to talk to. His life changed when a mysterious voice asked him to draw a sheep, which is where the story will continue. To be continued...\n",

      "The narrator, after being discouraged from becoming a painter as a child, learned to fly planes and traveled the world. He had many interactions with grown-ups, but they never truly understood him, always seeing his childhood drawing as a hat. The narrator lived a solitary life until his plane broke down in the Sahara desert six years ago. While stranded, he was surprised by a mysterious little voice asking him to draw a sheep. Despite his initial inability to draw, the little voice persisted, and the narrator eventually drew several sheep, each being rejected for various reasons. Finally, when the narrator drew a sheep inside a box, the little voice was satisfied, saying it was exactly what he wanted. The narrator then made the acquaintance of the little prince, who asked him many questions but never seemed to hear his in return. The narrator is still trying to understand where the little prince came from, and the little prince's words slowly reveal more about his story. To be continued...\n",
