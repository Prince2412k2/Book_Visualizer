I
The narrator begins by explaining their dedication to a book, acknowledging that they have several excuses for writing it, including being a grown-up in France who needs comfort, and dedicating it to someone who was once a child. At six years old, they were fascinated by a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing a wild beast in a book called "Stories of Life." This inspired them to draw their first picture, which they showed to grown-ups, who misunderstood it as a hat. Despite their efforts to clarify, the grown-ups remained confused, leading the narrator to abandon their artistic pursuits and focus on learning to fly planes instead.

Throughout life, the narrator encountered many grown-ups but found them lacking in understanding. They occasionally shared their childhood drawings with adults, hoping to find someone who could appreciate them, but were met with the same misunderstandings. Eventually, a mechanical breakdown in the Sahara desert left the narrator stranded. In a moment of desperation, a small voice asked the narrator to draw a sheep, a request that initially startled them. The story ends with the narrator preparing to respond to this unusual request, leaving the outcome to be continued.




II
In the previous chapters, the narrator, having abandoned their artistic pursuits due to misunderstandings by grown-ups, became a pilot and flew all over the world. Despite encountering many adults, they found them mostly unenlightened and often preferred to discuss mundane topics like bridge, golf, and ties. Six years ago, the narrator experienced a mechanical breakdown in the Sahara Desert, leaving them stranded and alone. Desperate, they were approached by a small voice requesting a drawing of a sheep. The narrator, initially startled, began to draw, only to be repeatedly corrected by the little prince, who clarified that he wanted a healthy, hornless, and long-lived sheep. The narrator eventually drew a simple box, which the little prince accepted, saying it was exactly how he wanted it. The narrator then learned that the little prince came from another planet and had been traveling the cosmos, asking questions and seeking understanding. The chapter ends with the little prince examining the narrator's plane for the first time, setting the stage for further interaction between them. To be continued.




III
In the previous chapters, the narrator, now stranded in the Sahara Desert, encountered the little prince, who asked for a drawing of a sheep. The narrator, after several attempts, drew a simple box, which the little prince accepted. This encounter led to the little prince examining the narrator's plane for the first time, revealing his curiosity and the start of their interactions.

In this chapter, the narrator and the little prince continue their conversation. The little prince, initially intrigued by the narratorâ€™s plane, asks what it is, to which the narrator explains it is a flying machine. The little prince humorously suggests that the narrator must have fallen from heaven, which irritates the narrator. The little prince then asks if the narrator also comes from heaven, leading to the narrator's question about the little prince's origin.

The little prince remains evasive about his home planet, instead focusing on the sheep the narrator had drawn. He expresses that the box will serve as a house for the sheep at night, and the narrator offers to provide a rope and picket to tie it up during the day. This suggestion confuses and amuses the little prince, who believes that the sheep can simply go wherever it wants, as it is small and at home wherever it is.

The narrator then learns that the little prince's planet is incredibly small, barely larger than a house. This revelation is not surprising to the narrator, who knows about the existence of numerous small asteroids that are difficult to see with a telescope. These asteroids are given numerical names by astronomers, such as "the asteroid 325."

To be continued.




IV
In the previous chapters, the narrator and the little prince continued their conversation, with the little prince finding the narrator's suggestion to tie up the sheep with a rope and picket amusing and unnecessary. The little prince believed that the sheep, being small, was at home wherever it went. The narrator then discovered that the little prince's planet was incredibly small, about the size of a house, which he found unsurprising given his knowledge of numerous small asteroids often named numerically by astronomers, such as "the asteroid 325."

In this chapter, the narrator reflects on the little prince's planet and its name, "asteroid B 612," which he believes is the correct one. He mentions an incident where a Turkish astronomer discovered the asteroid in 1909 but was not believed due to his costume. However, when the astronomer returned in 1920 dressed in European attire, his discovery was accepted. The narrator laments that adults often rely on numbers and material details rather than understanding the essence of things, such as the little prince's existence, which they would find more convincing if tied to a specific numerical designation.

The narrator expresses his regret for not starting the story in a more fairy-tale manner, as it would have seemed more true to those who understand life. He explains that he is recounting these memories to avoid forgetting his friend and to ensure that the story of the little prince is not lost. He mentions his attempt to draw portraits of the little prince, acknowledging his struggle with capturing details accurately, especially the sheep, which the little prince could see through the boxes.

The chapter ends with the narrator learning about the drama of the baobabs on the little prince's planet, setting the stage for further exploration of the planet's unique challenges and the little prince's experiences there. To be continued.




V
In this chapter, the narrator continues to reflect on the little prince's planet, "asteroid B 612," and the story of its discovery by a Turkish astronomer in 1909, highlighting how adults often overlook the importance of understanding the essence of things in favor of numerical details. The narrator expresses his regret for not starting the story in a more fairy-tale manner, as he believes it would have seemed more true to those who understand life. He mentions his attempts to draw portraits of the little prince, acknowledging his struggles with capturing details accurately, especially the sheep, which the little prince could see through the boxes.

The chapter then shifts to the narrator learning about the drama of the baobabs on the little prince's planet. The little prince inquires about whether the sheep eat shrubs and baobabs, leading to a discussion about the nature of baobabs and the importance of addressing their seeds early to prevent them from overtaking the planet. The little prince explains that baobabs, if left unchecked, can grow too large and potentially cause the planet to burst. He emphasizes the need for discipline and regular care to ensure the planet remains habitable.

The narrator draws a picture of a planet infested with baobabs, driven by a sense of urgency to warn others about the danger. He explains that he tried to create more grandiose drawings but could not succeed, as his focus was on conveying the importance of the baobab threat. The chapter ends with the narrator and the little prince discussing sunsets, setting the stage for further exploration of the little prince's experiences and the themes of the story. To be continued.




VI
In this chapter, the narrator delves deeper into the little prince's melancholic life and the significance of sunsets on his planet. The little prince reveals that he once saw the sun set forty-four times in a single day, a detail that highlights his deep connection to the beauty and routine of his world. The narrator notes the little prince's statement that he feels at home, suggesting a profound sense of belonging and familiarity.

The chapter then shifts to the fifth day, where the narrator learns more about the little prince's life through a question about sheep and flowers. The little prince inquires whether sheep eat flowers, including those with thorns, leading to a discussion about the purpose of thorns. The narrator, preoccupied with fixing his engine, provides a dismissive answer, but the little prince is unconvinced, suggesting that thorns are a defense mechanism for flowers, which he perceives as weak and naive.

The narrator's irritation with the engine repair and his dismissive response to the little prince's question set the stage for further exploration of the little prince's perspective on life and the importance of understanding the true nature of things. To be continued.




VII
On the fifth day, the little prince reveals a significant aspect of his life to the narrator by asking whether sheep eat flowers, including those with thorns. The narrator, preoccupied with fixing his engine, dismisses the question, suggesting that thorns are useless. However, the little prince is unconvinced and believes that thorns serve as a defense mechanism for flowers, which he perceives as weak and naive.

The little prince's frustration with the narrator's dismissive attitude leads to a deeper critique of adult preoccupations. He mentions a "serious man" on another planet who spends his days doing additions, which the little prince considers meaningless compared to understanding the importance of flowers and their thorns. The little prince becomes increasingly upset, believing that the potential destruction of his unique flower by a sheep is a matter of great importance.

The narrator, feeling ashamed and awkward, attempts to console the little prince, offering to draw a muzzle for the sheep and an armor for the flower. However, he realizes he is unsure how to help or reach the little prince's emotional state. The chapter ends with the little prince bursting into tears, highlighting the profound connection he has with his flower and the depth of his feelings. To be continued.




VIII
In the following chapter, the narrator learns more about the little prince's unique flower. The flower on the little prince's planet was unlike the simple, fleeting flowers that appeared and disappeared daily. This particular flower had grown from a mysterious seed and had taken days to prepare for its debut, carefully choosing its colors and arranging its petals. When it finally bloomed at sunrise, it was beautiful, but also somewhat pretentious, greeting the little prince with a yawn and a request for breakfast.

The little prince was deeply moved by the flower's beauty and the effort it had put into its appearance. However, the flower soon began to make demands and express her needs, such as protection from drafts and the need for a globe at night. The flower's requests and her eventual revelation about tigers and claws caused the little prince to doubt her sincerity and led to misunderstandings and unhappiness.

The little prince came to realize that he should have judged the flower based on its actions rather than its words, and that he had been too young to understand true love. He confided in the narrator that he should not have left the flower and that he should have seen through her manipulations to understand her underlying tenderness. The chapter ends with the little prince reflecting on the contradictions of flowers and the complexity of love. To be continued.




IX
In the following chapter, the little prince reflects further on his relationship with his flower and the lessons he learned from it. Despite the flower's initial beauty and the effort she put into her appearance, her demands and manipulations led to misunderstandings and unhappiness between them. The little prince realizes that he should have judged her based on her actions rather than her words and that he was too young to understand true love. He regrets leaving the flower and wishes he had seen through her pretensions to recognize her underlying tenderness.

On the morning of his departure, the little prince carefully tends to his planet, including his volcanoes and baobabs, with a sense of melancholy. As he prepares to leave, he feels a desire to weep while watering his flower and preparing to shelter her under her globe. The flower, however, asks him to leave, revealing her four thorns and showing him that she can fend for herself, even against beasts. Despite her pride, she secretly wants him to leave without seeing her cry.

After leaving his planet, the little prince travels to the region of the asteroids, specifically visiting asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He begins his journey by visiting the first asteroid, which is inhabited by a king. The king, seated on a simple yet majestic throne, is dressed in purple and ermine. To be continued.




X
In the following chapter, the little prince departs from his planet with a heavy heart, tending to his volcanoes and baobabs with a sense of melancholy. Despite his flower's prideful display of thorns and her request for him to leave, he feels a deep regret for not recognizing her true nature and wishes he had stayed. After leaving his planet, he travels to the region of the asteroids, starting with asteroid 325, which is inhabited by a king. The king, seated on a simple yet majestic throne, is dressed in purple and ermine. Upon meeting the little prince, the king views him as a new subject, which confuses the little prince. The king, who believes he reigns over everything he can see, including the stars, demands unreasonable things from the little prince, such as yawning on command and ordering the sun to set. The little prince, however, maintains his dignity and politely declines, pointing out the absurdity of such orders. Despite the king's attempts to make the little prince a minister and an ambassador, the little prince remains unimpressed by the king's authority and eventually leaves the asteroid. To be continued.




XI
In the following chapter, the little prince continues his journey through the asteroid belt, visiting asteroid 326, which is home to a conceited man. Upon arrival, the conceited man, mistaking the little prince for an admirer, eagerly greets him. The conceited man's sole purpose is to be admired, and he instructs the little prince to salute his hat by clapping his hands together. The little prince, finding this repetitive and pointless, eventually tires of the ritual and attempts to engage the conceited man in meaningful conversation. However, the conceited man is only interested in hearing praise and cannot understand the little prince's questions or concerns. After a brief and unsatisfactory interaction, the little prince leaves, reflecting on the peculiarities of grown-ups. His next stop is asteroid 327, where he encounters a drinker who is surrounded by both full and empty bottles. The drinker explains that he drinks to forget, but when the little prince asks what he is trying to forget, the drinker cannot provide an answer. This encounter leaves the little prince feeling melancholy and ponders the reasons behind the drinker's sorrow. To be continued.




XII
In the next chapter, the little prince visits asteroid 327, where he encounters a drinker surrounded by both full and empty bottles. The drinker explains that he drinks to forget, but when the little prince inquires further, the drinker reveals that he drinks to forget his shame. When pressed for more details, the drinker admits to being ashamed of drinking. This encounter leaves the little prince puzzled and melancholy, reinforcing his growing understanding of the peculiar and often self-destructive nature of grown-ups. To be continued.




XIII
In the previous chapter, the little prince visited asteroid 327 and met a drinker who drank to forget his shame, which only compounded his problem. This encounter left the little prince puzzled and reinforced his view of the peculiar and often self-destructive nature of grown-ups.

In the next chapter, the little prince visited the fourth planet, where he met a businessman who was so engrossed in his work that he barely acknowledged the little prince's presence. The businessman was obsessed with counting and owning stars, which he believed made him rich. Despite the little prince's attempts to understand the businessman's logic, he found it nonsensical. The businessman's reasoning reminded the little prince of the drinker's flawed logic, both failing to see the value in things that were not tangible or useful in a practical sense.

The little prince then visited the fifth planet, which was extremely small, containing only a lamppost and its lighter. The little prince found it strange that a lamppost and a lighter could exist on a planet without a population or structures. However, he found the lamppost lighter's work to be beautiful and useful, as he brought light to the planet, much like creating a star or a flower. This encounter provided a contrast to the previous two, offering a sense of beauty and purpose in the little prince's eyes.

To be continued.




XIV
In the latest chapter, the little prince visited the fifth planet, which was the smallest of all, containing only a lamppost and its lighter. Initially, the little prince found it strange how a lamppost and a lighter could exist on a planet without a population or structures. However, he came to appreciate the lamppost lighter's work as beautiful and useful, much like creating a star or a flower. The lighter's routine of turning the lamppost on and off seemed absurd to the little prince, as the planet's rotation had accelerated to the point where the lighter had no time to rest, working continuously with no breaks.

The little prince, feeling sympathetic towards the lighter, suggested a way for the lighter to rest by taking advantage of the planet's small size and rapid rotation. However, the lighter preferred his routine, valuing sleep over restful leisure. The little prince felt a connection with the lighter, seeing him as the only person he could have made a friend with among the grown-ups he had encountered. Despite this, he realized that the planet was too small to accommodate two, and he left with a sense of regret, particularly over the frequent sunsets that occurred every minute.

To be continued.




XV
In the latest chapter, the little prince visited the sixth planet, which was ten times larger than the fifth. This planet was inhabited by a geographer who wrote enormous books. The little prince found the geographer's work intriguing but was disappointed when he realized the geographer could not actually explore or know anything about the planet he was documenting. The geographer explained that he relied on explorers to provide information, but he was skeptical of their accounts, especially those of drunk explorers who might see double. The little prince shared a story about a friend who would be a bad explorer, and the geographer agreed that such a person existed.

When the little prince described his own planet, the geographer was unimpressed, noting that flowers were ephemeral and not worth documenting in his serious books. This made the little prince think about his own flower, which was threatened with disappearance and had only four thorns for protection. Despite his initial sadness, the little prince continued his journey with renewed courage, asking the geographer for advice on his next destination. The geographer suggested Earth, noting its good reputation.

The little prince then visited the Earth, which was not a planet in the traditional sense but rather a diverse and populous planet with a hundred and eleven kings, seven thousand geographers, nine hundred thousand businessmen, seven and a half million drunkards, three hundred and eleven million vain individuals, and about two billion large people. The little prince was overwhelmed by the Earth's vast population and the sheer number of people engaged in various professions.

To be continued.




XVI
In the latest chapter, the little prince continued his journey to the Earth, which was not a traditional planet but a diverse and populous one. Upon arrival, he was overwhelmed by the sheer number of inhabitants and the various professions they engaged in, such as kings, geographers, businessmen, drunkards, and vain individuals. The geographer had advised him to visit Earth due to its good reputation.

The little prince was particularly struck by the vast number of street lamp lighters needed before the invention of electricity. He imagined the coordinated efforts of these lighters across different continents, creating a ballet-like spectacle. However, he also noted the relative insignificance of humanity in terms of space, suggesting that if all two billion inhabitants stood together, they could fit into a small public square.

The little prince's reflections made him consider the importance of his own flower and the responsibilities he had left behind. Despite his initial sadness, he continued his journey with renewed courage, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

To be continued.




XVII
In the latest chapter, the little prince arrived on Earth, a planet teeming with a vast number of inhabitants engaged in various professions. The geographer had recommended this visit, praising Earth's reputation. Upon landing, the little prince was surprised to find the desert rather than the bustling city he had expected. He encountered a serpent who informed him he had landed in Africa, where there were indeed no people to be seen.

The little prince was further struck by the realization that, despite the planet's enormous size, all two billion inhabitants could fit into a small public square if they stood close together. This made him reflect on the relative insignificance of humanity in the vastness of space.

The little prince then shared his challenges with a flower he had left behind on his home planet. The serpent, known for its cryptic speech, spoke of its own power and the possibility of helping the little prince return to his planet one day. The two remained silent, each lost in their thoughts.

To be continued.




XVIII
In the latest chapter, the little prince continued his journey across the vast desert of Earth, encountering a flower with only three petals. Despite its seemingly insignificant appearance, the flower had once seen a caravan of men, though it could not provide a precise location as the wind had scattered them. The flower lacked roots and thus felt unanchored, much like the travelers it had observed. The little prince, after a brief exchange, decided to continue his journey, bidding farewell to the flower.

Meanwhile, the little prince and the serpent remained in a state of silent reflection. The serpent, with its cryptic and somewhat unsettling manner, claimed to be more powerful than any king's finger and promised to help the little prince return to his home planet if he ever wished to do so. The little prince, though intrigued, remained silent, unimpressed by the serpent's claims.

To be continued.




XIX
In the latest chapter, the little prince ascended a high mountain, hoping to see the entire planet and all its inhabitants from this vantage point. However, he saw only sharp, rocky needles and was greeted by an echo that repeated his words. This encounter left him feeling lonely and disappointed, as the landscape was dry, pointed, and salty. The little prince reflected on the lack of imagination among men, contrasting it with his own flower, which always spoke first.

Continuing his journey, the little prince eventually discovered a road, leading him to a garden filled with roses. Upon seeing the roses, he realized that they all resembled his own flower, which added to his sense of confusion and sadness, as he longed for the unique and individual nature of his own plant.

To be continued.




XX
In the latest chapter, the little prince, feeling lonely and disappointed after his ascent to the mountain, stumbled upon a road leading to a garden filled with roses. The roses, all identical, reminded him of his own flower, which he had believed to be unique. This realization brought him great sadness, as he imagined his flower's distress at seeing so many lookalikes. He lay in the grass, contemplating his loss of uniqueness and the emptiness of his own garden, which now seemed ordinary with just three volcanoes and an ordinary rose. As he was lying there, a fox appeared, greeting him politely. The little prince, feeling a need for companionship, suggested playing, but the fox explained that it was not domesticated and could not play. The little prince, understanding, apologized.

To be continued.




XXI
In the latest chapter, the little prince encounters the fox, who explains the concept of "taming." The fox clarifies that taming creates a bond, making one unique to the other. The little prince reflects on his own rose, realizing she might have tamed him. The fox describes how taming brings joy and significance to life, making ordinary things special. The little prince begins to tame the fox, sitting closer each day, and learns about the importance of rituals and routines in life.

The fox teaches the little prince that what is essential is invisible to the eye, and the importance of his rose lies in the time he spent with her and the care he gave her. As the little prince prepares to leave, the fox gives him a secret: one sees only with the heart, and it is the time spent that makes something important.

The little prince then revisits the garden of roses, now understanding that his rose is unique because of their bond. The roses feel embarrassed by this realization. The little prince returns to the fox, who reminds him of his responsibility towards his rose.

The next morning, the little prince meets the switchman, who sorts travelers into bundles and directs them to different destinations. To be continued.




XXII
In the latest chapter, the little prince revisits the garden of roses, now understanding that his rose is unique due to their bond, which makes the other roses feel embarrassed. He returns to the fox, who reminds him of his responsibility towards his rose. The fox's teachings about the importance of time spent and the invisible essence of things deeply impact the little prince.

The next morning, the little prince meets the switchman, who sorts travelers into bundles and directs them to different destinations. The switchman explains that the travelers are in constant motion, often unhappy with their current locations and seeking something elsewhere. The little prince reflects on the children's ability to find importance in simple things, like a rag doll, which the switchman considers lucky. To be continued.




XXIII
In the latest chapter, the little prince continues his journey and meets the merchant of sophisticated pills that quench thirst for a week. The little prince questions the merchant about the purpose of such pills, pointing out that people could use the saved time to walk to a fountain instead. The merchant emphasizes the efficiency and time-saving aspect, but the little prince finds value in the experience and act of walking. The narrative then shifts to the narrator, who is still in the desert on the eighth day of his breakdown, having heard the merchant's story and drinking the last of his water. To be continued.




XXIV
In the latest chapter, the little prince continues his journey and meets a merchant who sells sophisticated pills that quench thirst for a week. The little prince questions the merchant about the purpose of these pills, arguing that people could use the saved time to walk to a fountain instead. The merchant emphasizes the efficiency and time-saving aspects, but the little prince values the experience and act of walking.

The narrative then shifts to the narrator, who is still in the desert on the eighth day of his breakdown. He has heard the merchant's story and is drinking the last of his water. Despite his dire situation, he finds comfort in the company of the little prince. The little prince, not understanding the urgency of the situation, mentions his fox friend and the importance of having a friend even in dire circumstances. The narrator, realizing the futility of looking for a well at random, decides to continue walking with the little prince.

As they walk through the night, the narrator reflects on the beauty of the desert and the stars, drawing parallels to the little prince's earlier statements about the hidden well. The little prince explains that what makes the desert beautiful is the well hidden within it, much like how a house or the stars gain their beauty from something invisible. The narrator is touched by the little prince's faith and the fragile nature of their bond.

The little prince falls asleep, and the narrator, feeling a sense of responsibility, carries him. As they walk, the narrator discovers a well at dawn, which the little prince had spoken about. The well, unlike typical Saharan wells, resembles a village well, complete with a pulley, bucket, and rope, adding to the mystery and wonder of their discovery. To be continued.




XXV
In the latest chapter, the little prince and the narrator continue their journey through the desert after discovering a mysterious well. The little prince reflects on the futility of men searching for something without knowing what they are looking for, drawing a parallel to the well they found, which was not a typical Saharan well but resembled a village well complete with a pulley, bucket, and rope. The little prince explains that the well's beauty lies in its hidden nature, much like the beauty of a house or the stars.

The narrator hoists the bucket, and the little prince drinks the water, finding it sweet and meaningful, born from their journey and the effort involved. The little prince then reminds the narrator of his promise to make a muzzle for his sheep, and the narrator, despite his previous embarrassment over his drawings, creates a muzzle for the fox. The little prince also mentions the anniversary of his fall to Earth, causing the narrator to question if their meeting was not by chance and if the little prince was returning to the site of his fall.

The next evening, the narrator returns to the well, only to find the little prince sitting on a ruin of an old stone wall, speaking to someone or something unseen. The little prince guides the narrator by describing his trace in the sand and mentions the venom, causing the narrator concern. The little prince then asks the narrator to leave, saying he wants to go down again, leaving the narrator with a sense of unease and anticipation. To be continued.




XXVI
In the latest chapter, the narrator returns to the well the next evening, finding the little prince sitting on a ruin of an old stone wall, speaking to someone unseen. The little prince guides the narrator by describing his trace in the sand and mentions venom, which concerns the narrator. The little prince then asks the narrator to leave, saying he wants to go down again. Upon closer inspection, the narrator discovers a yellow snake near the little prince, who is pale as snow. The narrator rushes to his side, finding the snake sinking into the sand. The little prince, who seems to be in great distress, tells the narrator about his journey home, mentioning his sheep, the case for the sheep, and the muzzle the narrator made for him. The little prince expresses his desire for the narrator to watch the stars at night, as his star will be one of them, and he will laugh in one of them, making all the stars seem to laugh. The little prince insists that the narrator should not come to see him leave, as it will not be worth it, and he is anxious about the snake. Despite the narrator's protests, the little prince sets off quietly, and the narrator follows him. The little prince takes a step, and there is a yellow flash near his ankle, causing him to fall gently like a tree. The narrator finds no body the next morning and is left to wonder about the fate of the little prince's flower on his planet. To be continued.




XXVII
In the subsequent chapter, the narrator reflects on the passage of six years since the little prince's departure. He recounts how his comrades were relieved to see him alive, attributing his survival to fatigue. The narrator has found some comfort in the nighttime, finding solace in the sound of the stars, which he compares to five hundred million bells. However, he is plagued by a persistent mystery: whether the little prince's flower on his planet was eaten by the sheep.

The narrator frequently debates this scenario with himself. He imagines the little prince's meticulous care for his flower and sheep, and the potential oversight that could have led to the flower's demise. These thoughts cause him emotional turmoil, as he oscillates between hope and despair, imagining the stars laughing or crying based on the fate of the flower.

The narrator emphasizes the profound impact of this mystery, suggesting that the universe itself changes based on whether the flower was eaten. He encourages the reader to look at the sky and ponder this question, acknowledging that only those who understand the little prince's world can truly grasp its significance.

The chapter concludes with the narrator's drawing of the landscape where the little prince appeared and disappeared, urging the reader to recognize it if they ever travel to Africa's desert. He asks the reader to wait under a star if they encounter a child who fits the little prince's description, imploring them to be kind and to report back to him if the little prince has returned. To be continued.
