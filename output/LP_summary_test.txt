I
The narrator begins by explaining their dedication to a book, acknowledging that they have several excuses for writing it, including being a grown-up in France who needs comfort, and dedicating it to someone who was once a child. At six years old, they were fascinated by a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing a wild beast in a book called "Stories of Life." This inspired them to draw their first picture, which they showed to grown-ups, who misunderstood it as a hat. Despite their efforts to clarify, the grown-ups remained confused, leading the narrator to abandon their artistic pursuits and focus on learning to fly planes instead.

Throughout life, the narrator encountered many grown-ups but found them lacking in understanding. They occasionally shared their childhood drawings with adults, hoping to find someone who could appreciate them, but were met with the same misunderstandings. Eventually, a mechanical breakdown in the Sahara desert left the narrator stranded. In a moment of desperation, a small voice asked the narrator to draw a sheep, a request that initially startled them. The story ends with the narrator preparing to respond to this unusual request, leaving the outcome to be continued.




II
In the previous chapters, the narrator recounts their early fascination with drawing, particularly a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing a wild beast from a book called "Stories of Life." Despite their artistic ambitions, grown-ups consistently misunderstood their drawings, leading them to abandon art and pursue a career in flying planes. Throughout their life, the narrator encountered numerous grown-ups but found them lacking in understanding and appreciation. This led them to keep their drawings to themselves, only occasionally sharing them with adults who invariably interpreted them as hats.

Six years ago, the narrator's plane broke down in the Sahara desert, leaving them stranded with no help in sight. In a moment of desperation, a small voice asked the narrator to draw a sheep. Despite their initial shock and the fact that they had not drawn a sheep before, the narrator attempted to comply. However, each of their drawings was rejected by the little prince for various reasons—illness, being a ram, or being too old. Eventually, the narrator gave up and drew a box, claiming the sheep was inside. To their surprise, the little prince was satisfied with the drawing, leading to their meeting.

In this chapter, the narrator continues to describe their interactions with the little prince. The little prince's questions about the narrator's plane provide insight into his curiosity and his origins, which the narrator is still trying to uncover. The story is to be continued.




III
In this chapter, the narrator continues to interact with the little prince, who remains curious about the narrator's plane and their journey. The little prince's questions about the plane and the narrator's descent from the sky amuse him, leading to a moment of irritation for the narrator. The little prince's innocent assumption that the narrator also comes from heaven adds to the initial confusion.

The narrator's attempts to gather information about the little prince's origins are met with vague responses. The little prince reveals that he comes from a planet so small it is hardly larger than a house, which is a revelation that doesn't surprise the narrator given the existence of small, unnamed asteroids. The little prince's preoccupation with his sheep continues, and the narrator tries to suggest practical solutions like tying it up, which the little prince finds amusing and unnecessary.

The chapter ends with the little prince expressing a sense of melancholy, suggesting that he feels confined by the small size of his planet, emphasizing the vastness of the universe and the little prince's longing for more. To be continued.




IV
In this chapter, the narrator continues to engage with the little prince, who remains curious about the practical aspects of owning a sheep. The narrator suggests the idea of tying up the sheep to prevent it from wandering, but the little prince finds this amusing and unnecessary, emphasizing that his planet is so small that the sheep cannot go far. The little prince's melancholy deepens as he expresses his confinement by the size of his planet, highlighting his longing for a larger world.

The narrator then reveals that the little prince's planet is no larger than a house, which is unsurprising given the existence of small, unnamed asteroids like the asteroid B 612. The narrator explains the process of discovering and naming asteroids, including a humorous anecdote about a Turkish astronomer who was initially disbelieved due to his costume but later accepted after dressing in a more European style.

The narrator reflects on the tendency of "big people" to rely on numbers and tangible details rather than understanding the essence of things. He contrasts this with the way children and those who understand life deeply appreciate the intangible qualities of a friend or a story.

The narrator also mentions the difficulty of recounting these memories, especially since the little prince has been gone for six years. To preserve these memories, the narrator decides to draw portraits of the little prince, despite the challenges of drawing at his age. He acknowledges the possibility of making mistakes in his drawings but hopes to capture the essence of his friend.

On the third day of their journey, the little prince raises a serious question about the drama of baobabs, leading to further reflection and learning about the planet. To be continued.




V
In this chapter, the narrator continues to explore the relationship between the little prince and his sheep, delving deeper into the little prince's concerns about the sheep eating the baobabs on his tiny planet. The little prince's understanding of the necessity to remove the baobab seeds early to prevent them from growing into massive trees that could potentially destroy the planet is both practical and poignant, reflecting his responsibility and care for his home.

The narrator acknowledges the challenge of conveying the little prince's wisdom to a broader audience, particularly children, and undertakes to draw a picture of the baobabs as a warning. This effort underscores the narrator's commitment to preserving the little prince's teachings and memories.

The chapter also reveals the little prince's appreciation for the beauty of sunsets, which provides a brief moment of joy in his otherwise melancholic life. This detail adds depth to the little prince's character, highlighting his capacity for finding beauty and solace in the small things.

To be continued.




VI
In this chapter, the narrator further explores the little prince's daily routine and emotional state on his planet. He reveals that the little prince enjoyed watching sunsets, finding solace in their beauty, and would often see them multiple times a day by simply moving his chair. The narrator learns that the little prince felt particularly close to home during these moments.

The chapter then delves into a conversation between the narrator and the little prince about the sheep and the flowers. The little prince questions the purpose of thorns on flowers, which the narrator initially dismisses as unnecessary and a sign of the flowers' naivety. However, the little prince disagrees, suggesting that flowers use thorns as a defense mechanism. This exchange highlights the little prince's deep, almost philosophical, curiosity about the world around him.

The narrator's own troubles with his engine add a layer of tension to the chapter, as he struggles with a stubborn bolt and dwindling water supplies. Despite these personal challenges, the little prince's questions and reflections continue to engage the narrator's attention.

To be continued.




VII
In Chapter VII, the little prince reveals to the narrator a profound question about the purpose of thorns on flowers, which he had been contemplating in silence. The little prince's inquiry about whether sheep eat flowers, including those with thorns, prompts the narrator to dismiss thorns as unnecessary and a sign of the flowers' naivety. However, the little prince counters with the idea that flowers use thorns as a defense mechanism, showcasing his deep curiosity and philosophical thinking.

The chapter also delves into the narrator's personal struggles with his engine, where he is preoccupied with a stubborn bolt and running out of water, adding a layer of tension to the narrative. Despite these challenges, the little prince's questions continue to engage the narrator's attention. The little prince becomes increasingly frustrated with the narrator's dismissive attitude, leading to a heated exchange that highlights the contrast between the little prince's childlike wonder and the narrator's more pragmatic, adult perspective.

The little prince's anger culminates as he expresses his belief in the importance of understanding the relationships between flowers and sheep, and how this is more significant than the "serious" tasks of grown-ups, like mathematical calculations. The narrator, feeling ashamed and awkward, attempts to console the little prince, who is on the verge of tears, by offering to draw a muzzle for the sheep and armor for the flower.

In Chapter VIII, the narrator learns more about the little prince's unique flower. The flower had germinated from a mysterious seed and had taken days to prepare for its full bloom, carefully choosing its colors and arranging its petals. The little prince had watched the flower's development with great anticipation, treating it with care and admiration. The flower's slow and deliberate emergence underscores its special significance to the little prince.

To be continued.




VIII
In Chapter VIII, the narrator learns more about the little prince's unique flower. The flower had originated from a mysterious seed and had taken days to prepare for its full bloom, carefully choosing its colors and arranging its petals. The little prince had watched its development with great anticipation and care, treating it with admiration. The flower's deliberate and slow emergence underscores its special significance to the little prince.

One morning, the flower finally appeared, and it greeted the little prince with a yawn, saying, "Ah! I'm just waking up... I beg your pardon... I'm still disheveled..." The little prince was filled with admiration for its beauty. The flower then began to make demands, asking for breakfast and a screen to protect herself from drafts, which the little prince interpreted as a sign of vanity.

The flower's conversation about her thorns and fear of tigers further complicated the little prince's feelings. When the little prince pointed out that there were no tigers on his planet, the flower tried to justify herself with a naive lie about needing a screen. This lie embarrassed the flower, and she coughed to make the little prince feel guilty.

The little prince, despite his initial goodwill, began to doubt the flower's sincerity. He realized that he had taken her words too seriously and had become unhappy. He confided to the narrator that he should not have listened to the flower and should have judged her based on her actions rather than her words. The little prince also reflected on how he should have understood her tenderness behind her tricks and how he was too young to know how to love her.

To be continued.




IX
In Chapter IX, the little prince prepares to leave his asteroid, having organized his planet and tended to his volcanoes and baobabs. He feels a deep sense of melancholy and discovers a desire to weep when he waters the flower for the last time. The flower, who had been silent, finally speaks, apologizing for her previous behavior and urging the little prince to be happy. Despite her earlier vanity and tricks, she expresses her love for him, acknowledging that he was also naive. She asks him to leave her globe behind, as she is resilient enough to face the elements and potential threats, such as caterpillars and beasts, which she believes will bring beauty and visitors to her. The little prince, surprised by her quiet sweetness and proud demeanor, departs with the globe in his hand, deciding not to see her cry.

The little prince then travels to the region of asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330, seeking an occupation and knowledge. He begins his journey by visiting the first asteroid, which is inhabited by a king. The king, seated on a simple yet majestic throne, is dressed in purple and ermine.

To be continued.




X
In Chapter X, the little prince continues his journey through the region of asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330, seeking an occupation and knowledge. His first stop is asteroid 325, where he meets a king who is seated on a simple yet majestic throne, adorned in purple and ermine. Despite the king's grandeur, the little prince finds the situation peculiar and questions how the king can rule over such a small planet. The king, however, asserts his authority over all things, from his tiny asteroid to the stars themselves, and demands that the little prince obey his commands, including ordering him to yawn and sit down. When the little prince requests to see a sunset, the king promises to make it happen but delays, claiming the conditions are not yet favorable. The little prince, growing bored and realizing he has nothing to do there, prepares to leave. The king, in an attempt to keep him, offers the little prince the position of Minister of Justice, though there is no one to judge. The king suggests the little prince could judge an old rat he hears at night, but the little prince declines, preferring not to condemn to death. The king then offers him the role of ambassador, but the little prince, having completed his preparations, decides to leave. The little prince reflects on the peculiar nature of great people as he continues his journey.

To be continued.




XI
In Chapter XI, the little prince travels to asteroid 326, where he meets a conceited man who believes that everyone is there to admire him. The conceited man is initially delighted to see the little prince, whom he assumes is an admirer. However, the little prince, not understanding the conceited man's expectations, does not know how to respond appropriately. The conceited man explains that his hat is for saluting when he is acclaimed, but since no one ever passes by, he has no one to salute. He instructs the little prince to clap his hands, which he does, and the conceited man then salutes his hat. This repetitive action becomes tedious for the little prince, who eventually asks how to make the hat fall, but the conceited man, being absorbed in his own vanity, does not hear him. The little prince, realizing that the conceited man only wants praise, decides to leave. On his journey, the little prince reflects on the strangeness of grown-ups.

In Chapter XII, the little prince visits asteroid 327, where he encounters a drinker surrounded by a collection of empty and full bottles. The drinker explains that he drinks to forget, but when the little prince inquires what he is trying to forget, the drinker cannot provide an answer. The little prince, feeling a sense of pity for the drinker, decides to leave the asteroid. This encounter leaves the little prince feeling melancholic and he continues to reflect on the peculiarities of adults.

To be continued.




XII
In Chapter XIII, the little prince travels to asteroid 328, where he meets a businessman who is counting the stars. The businessman explains that he owns the stars and is counting them to keep track of his wealth. The little prince finds this idea absurd and attempts to explain that the stars belong to everyone, but the businessman is too engrossed in his counting to understand. The little prince tries to engage the businessman in a conversation about the stars, but the businessman only wants to talk about his ownership of them. Eventually, the little prince, feeling frustrated and unable to connect with the businessman, decides to leave the asteroid. As he departs, he reflects further on the peculiar and often self-centered nature of grown-ups. To be continued.




XIII
In Chapter XIV, the little prince travels to the fifth planet, which is the smallest of all the planets he has visited. This planet is so tiny that it only has room for a lamppost and its keeper, the street lamp lighter. The little prince finds it perplexing how a lamppost and its lighter could be useful on a planet devoid of houses or inhabitants. Despite his confusion, he reflects that the lamppost lighter's work, though seemingly absurd, is less so than the occupations he has encountered on other planets. He muses that lighting the lamppost is like creating a star or a flower, and turning it off puts that star or flower to sleep. He finds the lamppost lighter's work both useful and beautiful. To be continued.




XIV
In Chapter XV, the little prince continues his journey from the fifth planet, reflecting on his encounter with the lamppost lighter. He marvels at the man's dedication to his task, despite the absurdity of lighting a lamppost on a planet without inhabitants. The little prince feels a deep connection to the lamppost lighter, appreciating his faithfulness and the beauty of his work. However, he realizes that the planet is too small to accommodate two, and he is left with a bittersweet feeling, partly due to the thousand four hundred and forty sunsets he witnessed in just twenty-four hours. The little prince's thoughts turn to the other inhabitants he has met on his journey—the king, the vain man, the drunkard, and the businessman—whom he finds ridiculous. He contemplates why the lamppost lighter stands out as the only one who doesn't seem absurd to him, perhaps because he cares only for himself. To be continued.




XV
In Chapter XVI, the little prince continues his journey to the Earth, which he discovers is vastly different from the other planets he has visited. Unlike the lamppost lighter's dedication or the geographer's importance in his own domain, the Earth is teeming with a multitude of inhabitants: a hundred and eleven kings, seven thousand geographers, nine hundred thousand businessmen, seven and a half million drunkards, three hundred and eleven million vain individuals, and about two billion large people. The little prince is overwhelmed by the sheer number of people and their various occupations, none of which seem to have the same depth of meaning that he found on the other planets.

He reflects on the Earth's history, noting that before the invention of electricity, there was an army of four hundred and sixty-two thousand lamppost lighters maintaining lamps across the six continents. This detail resonates with his previous encounter with the lamppost lighter, highlighting the absurdity of such a task on a planet without inhabitants. The little prince is left contemplative, pondering the nature of human activity and its significance.

The little prince's thoughts return to his flower, whom he realizes is ephemeral and vulnerable, contrasting with the seemingly eternal nature of the geographical features of the Earth. This realization brings a new wave of regret, as he recalls leaving his flower alone. To be continued.




XVI
In Chapter XVII, the narrator clarifies that the vast numbers of people on Earth occupy very little space. If all two billion inhabitants stood together, they would fit into a public square measuring twenty miles by twenty miles, which could easily fit on the smallest island in the Pacific. The narrator emphasizes that despite the perception of importance and space among the "great people," this is a misconception. They see themselves as significant as baobabs, but in reality, their physical presence is minimal. The narrator advises not to waste time on this calculation, as people who believe they hold a lot of space will not be convinced. The little prince, reflecting on this information, continues to ponder the nature of human importance and the vastness of the Earth compared to the small scale of human activity. To be continued.




XVII
In Chapter XVIII, the little prince continues his observations and reflections in the desert, now in Africa. He is struck by the vastness of the Earth and the apparent absence of people, which contrasts sharply with the bustling imagery of the street lamp lighterers he had just imagined. The little prince's curiosity about the stars and his planet's position in the cosmos deepens as he gazes at the sky. He wonders if the stars are guides for people to find their way, and he expresses his longing for his own planet, which he sees as distant and yet beautiful.

The serpent, observing the little prince's contemplative state, engages him in conversation. The little prince inquires about the absence of people, and the serpent responds with a philosophical statement about the nature of loneliness, suggesting that one can feel isolated even among many people. The little prince finds the serpent's demeanor amusing and somewhat mysterious, noting its lack of physical attributes like paws and its inability to travel. However, the serpent asserts its own form of power, claiming it can carry the little prince farther than a ship and has the ability to return anyone it touches to their origin.

The serpent wraps itself around the little prince's ankle, comparing itself to a gold bracelet, and hints at its ability to assist the little prince if he ever regrets leaving his own planet. The little prince remains silent, finding the serpent's words cryptic and intriguing. The serpent promises to unravel its riddles, and the two fall into a reflective silence, setting the stage for further interactions and revelations. To be continued.




XVIII
In Chapter XIX, the little prince continues his journey across the vast desert, encountering only a single, insignificant flower with three petals. The flower, having seen a caravan in the past, informs the little prince about the presence of six or seven men, though their exact location is uncertain as they wander aimlessly without roots. The flower's response highlights the transient and rootless nature of human existence, contrasting sharply with the little prince's own sense of belonging to his own planet. The little prince, politely saying goodbye to the flower, reflects on the flower's words and the enigmatic encounter with the serpent. The serpent's cryptic statements and its promise to unravel its riddles continue to intrigue him, setting the stage for further interactions and deeper reflections on the nature of existence and the cosmos. To be continued.




XIX
In Chapter XX, the little prince continues his journey across the desert and ascends a high mountain, hoping to see the whole planet and all the men. However, he only sees sharp needles of rock and encounters an echo that repeats his words. This encounter leads him to reflect on the dry, pointed, and salty nature of the planet and the lack of imagination among its inhabitants. He contrasts this with his own planet and the unique, speaking flower he left behind.

After his reflection, the little prince continues walking through the sands, rocks, and snows until he discovers a road, which he realizes leads to men. Upon finding a garden filled with roses, he greets them, only to find that they all resemble the flower he once knew on his own planet. To be continued.




XX
In Chapter XXI, the little prince continues his journey through the garden of identical roses, feeling increasingly sad and disillusioned. He reflects on how his own flower, unique and special to him, would be upset to see so many lookalikes and would likely pretend to die out of embarrassment. This realization leaves him feeling lonely and insignificant. Just as he lies in the grass, feeling down, a fox appears. The little prince greets the fox politely, but when he doesn't see it, he is confused. The fox reveals itself from under an apple tree, introducing itself and expressing that it cannot play with the little prince because it is not domesticated. To be continued.




XXI
In Chapter XXII, the little prince continues his journey and encounters a switchman. The switchman is sorting travelers into groups of a thousand and directing them to different destinations, either to the right or the left. The little prince inquires about the switchman's duties, showing his curiosity about the adult world and the roles people play in it. The encounter highlights the switchman's mechanical and impersonal task, contrasting sharply with the little prince's more meaningful and emotional connections, such as his bond with the fox and his rose. To be continued.




XXII
In Chapter XXIII, the little prince continues his journey and meets a merchant who sells sophisticated pills that quench thirst. The merchant explains that with his pills, one can avoid the trouble of drinking water, as the pills provide the same satisfaction in just a few seconds. The little prince, however, questions the value of such a convenience, suggesting that the act of drinking water and the moments spent doing so are meaningful and enjoyable. This exchange further emphasizes the little prince's appreciation for the simple, genuine experiences in life, contrasting with the merchant's focus on efficiency and ease. To be continued.




XXIII
In Chapter XXIV, the little prince continues his journey and encounters a switchman who operates a railway crossing. The little prince observes flashing lights and hears thundering sounds, indicating passing trains. He inquires about the purpose of the trains and the switchman explains that people are never content with their current situation and are always in transit, looking for something else. The little prince contrasts this with children, who find value and importance in simple things like a rag doll. The switchman views children's perspective as lucky.

The little prince then meets a merchant who sells pills that quench thirst, allowing one to avoid the inconvenience of drinking water. The merchant claims that these pills save fifty-three minutes a week, which could be used for other activities. However, the little prince disagrees, suggesting that he would prefer to spend that time walking slowly towards a fountain, valuing the experience and enjoyment of drinking water over mere convenience.

The narrative shifts to the narrator, who is stranded in the desert on the eighth day of his breakdown. He has just heard the merchant's story while drinking the last drop of his water supply. To be continued.




XXIV
In Chapter XXV, the little prince reflects on the behavior of men, describing how they rush into the rapids without knowing what they seek, only to move in circles. He deems this pursuit unworthy. Meanwhile, the narrator and the little prince arrive at a well that does not resemble typical Saharan wells. This well is intricately equipped with a pulley, bucket, and rope, suggesting it might be a village well, though no village is in sight. The narrator finds the scene strange and wonders if he is dreaming. The little prince, however, touches the rope and pulls the pulley, which moans like an old weathervane that has been inactive for a long time. To be continued.




XXV
In Chapter XXV, the little prince reflects on the futility of men rushing into life's challenges without a clear purpose, likening their actions to moving in circles. He finds this pursuit unworthy. The narrator and the little prince arrive at a well that is intricately equipped with a pulley, bucket, and rope, which seems unusual for the desert. The narrator initially suspects he is dreaming, but the little prince touches the rope and pulls the pulley, which moans like an old, unused weathervane. The narrator helps the little prince hoist the bucket, and the water is described as sweet and meaningful, more than just a drink. The little prince remarks that men often fail to find what they seek despite having many roses in their gardens, emphasizing the importance of seeking with the heart. The narrator realizes the significance of gifts and memories, like the Christmas tree and the fox, which bring true joy.

The little prince mentions his need for a muzzle for his sheep and his responsibility for his flower. He blushes when the narrator asks about his fall on Earth and the anniversary approaching. The narrator is unsure if the little prince's journey back to the point of his fall was by chance or for his birthday. The little prince tells the narrator to go back to his machine and return the next night.

In Chapter XXVI, the narrator returns the next evening to find the little prince sitting on a ruined stone wall nearby, talking to someone or something unseen. The little prince mentions that his trace in the sand will show where he is, and he asks if the narrator has good venom, hinting at a potential injury. The narrator feels concerned and stops, but the little prince insists he wants to go down again. To be continued.




XXVI
In Chapter XXVI, the narrator returns the next evening to find the little prince sitting on a ruined stone wall, speaking to someone unseen. The little prince mentions that his trace in the sand will show where he is and asks if the narrator has good venom, hinting at a potential injury. The narrator feels concerned but the little prince insists he wants to go down again. As the narrator approaches, he discovers a yellow snake near the wall. The serpent retreats into the sand as the narrator reaches the wall, where he finds the little prince pale and in his arms. The little prince is melancholic, discussing his responsibilities and the significance of the stars, likening them to wells with pulleys and fountains. He shares his plan to return to his planet, emphasizing that it will be like an old abandoned boat and that he will look as if he is dead, but it will not be true. The little prince expresses his love for his flower and his responsibility towards her, despite her fragility. He takes a step, and a yellow flash near his ankle indicates he has been bitten by the snake. He falls gently into the sand, motionless and without a sound. To be continued.




XXVII
In Chapter XXVII, the narrator reflects on the events of six years prior, recalling the moment he found the little prince unconscious in the sand, bitten by a yellow snake. Initially, he was concerned and thought it was fatigue, but he now believes the little prince has returned to his planet since his body was not found the next morning. The narrator ponders what might have happened on the little prince's planet, particularly regarding the fate of the little prince's beloved flower, which he had enclosed in a glass globe each night. The narrator experiences conflicting emotions, imagining various scenarios—whether the little prince forgot to cover the flower or if the sheep accidentally ate it. These thoughts evoke a sense of mystery and sadness, as the narrator realizes the significance of the little prince's bond with his flower and the impact it has on his perception of the universe. The chapter ends with the narrator asking the reader to look at the sky and consider the fate of the flower, emphasizing the profound importance and emotional weight of the little prince's journey. To be continued.
