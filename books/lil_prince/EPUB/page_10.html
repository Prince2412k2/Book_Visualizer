    <p>'  ' I  \ thorns, which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a  fat red-faced gentleman’s sums? And if I  know, I, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a  single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing, Oh! You think that is not important! His face turned from white to red as he continued: “If some one loves a  flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.

They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a  trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a  seed blown from no one knew where, a  new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a  new kind of baobab. The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a  flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a  huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it.
