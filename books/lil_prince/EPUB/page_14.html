    <p>“I should like to see a  sunset... do me that kindness... Order the sun to set...” “If I  ordered a  general to fly from one flower to another like a  butterfly, or to write a  tragic drama, or to change himself into a  sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?” the king demanded. “The general, or myself?” “You,” said the little prince firmly. “Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform,” the king went on. “Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I  have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable.” “Then my sunset?” the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a  question once he had asked it. “You shall have your sunset. I  shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favourable.” “When will that be?” inquired the little prince. “Hum! Hum!” replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a  bulky almanac. “Hum! Hum! That will be about... about... that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I  am obeyed.” The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a  little bored. “I have nothing more to do here,” he said to the king. “So I  shall set out on my way again.” “Do not go,” said the king, who was very proud of having a  subject. “Do not go. I  will make you a  Minister!” “Minister of what?” “Minster of...of Justice!” “But there is nobody here to judge!” “We do not know that,” the king said to him. “I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I  am very old. There is no room here for a  carriage. And it tires me to walk.” “Oh, but I  have looked already!” said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all... “Then you shall judge yourself,” the king answered, “that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to j  udge oneself than to j  udge others. If you succeed in j  udging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a  man of true wisdom.”</p>
