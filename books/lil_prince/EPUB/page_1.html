    <p>My Drawing Number Two looked like this: The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I  gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a  painter. I  had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. So then I  chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I  have flown a  little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a  glance I  can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the course of this life I  have had a  great many encounters with a  great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I  have lived a  great deal among grown-ups. I  have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them. Whenever I  met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I  tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I  have always kept. I  would try to find out, so, if this was a  person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: “That is a hat.” Then I  would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I  would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a  sensible man. So I  lived my life alone, without anyone that I  could really talk to, until I  had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I  had with me neither a  mechanic nor any passengers, I  set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a  question of life or death for me: I  had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week. The first night, then, I  went to sleep on the sand, a  thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a  shipwrecked sailor on a  raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I  was awakened by an odd little voice.</p>
