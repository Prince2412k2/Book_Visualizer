    <p>this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game’s monotony. “And what should one do to make the hat come down?” he asked. But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise. “Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of the little prince. “What does that mean, ‘admire’?” “To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.” “But you are the only man on your planet!” “Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.” “I admire you,” said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, “but what is there in that to interest you so much?” And the little prince went away. “The grown-ups are certainly very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey. The next planet was inhabited by a  tippler. This was a  very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection. “What are you doing there?” he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a  collection of empty bottles and also a  collection of full bottles. “I am drinking,” replied the tippler, with a  lugubrious air. “Why are you drinking?” demanded the little prince. “So that I  may forget,” replied the tippler. “Forget what?” inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him. “Forget that I  am ashamed,” the tippler confessed, hanging his head. “Ashamed of what?” insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him. “Ashamed of drinking!” The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence. And the little prince went away, puzzled. “The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey. The fourth planet belonged to a  businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince’s arrival.</p>
