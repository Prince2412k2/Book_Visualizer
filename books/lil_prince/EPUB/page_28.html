    <p>The next day the little prince came back. “It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I  shall begin to be happy. I  shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I  shall already be worrying and jumping about. I  shall show you how happy I  am! But if you come at just any time, I  shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites...” “What is a  rite?” asked the little prince. “Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a  rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a  wonderful day for me! I  can take a  walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I  should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near... “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.” “It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...” “Yes, that is so,” said the fox. “But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince. “Yes, that is so,” said the fox. “Then it has done you no good at all!” “It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I  will make you a  present of a  secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses. “You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I  first knew him. He was only a  fox like a  hundred thousand other foxes. But I  have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I  have watered; because it is she that I  have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I  have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I  have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I  have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose. And he went back to meet the fox. “Goodbye,” he said. “Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a  very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”</p>
