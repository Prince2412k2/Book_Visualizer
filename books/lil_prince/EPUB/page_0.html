    <p>THE LITTLE PRINCE Antoine De Saint-Exupery Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who was a  French author, journalist and pilot wrote The Little Prince in 1943, one year before his death. The Little Prince appears to be a  simple children’s tale, some would say that it is actually a  profound and deeply moving tale, written in riddles and laced with philosophy and poetic metaphor. Once when I  was six years old I  saw a  magnificent picture in a  book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a  picture of a  boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a  copy of the drawing. In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.” I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a  coloured pencil I  succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: I  showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a  hat?” My drawing was not a  picture of a  hat. It was a  picture of a  boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grownups were not able to understand it, I  made another drawing: I  drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.</p>
