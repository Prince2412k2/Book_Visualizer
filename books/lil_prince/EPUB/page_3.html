    <p>So then I  made a  drawing. He looked at it carefully, then he said: “No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.” So I  made another drawing. My friend smiled gently and indulgently. “You see yourself,” he said, “that this is not a  sheep. This is a  ram. It has horns. So then I  did my drawing over once more. But it was rejected too, just like the others. “This one is too old. I  want a  sheep that will live a  long time. By this time my patience was exhausted, because I  was in a  hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I  tossed off this drawing. And I  threw out an explanation with it. “This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.” I  was very surprised to see a  light break over the face of my young judge: “That is exactly the way I  wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a  great deal of grass?” “Why?” “Because where I  live everything is very small...” “There will surely be enough grass for him,” I  said. “It is a  very small sheep that I  have given you.” He bent his head over the drawing: “Not so small that, Look! He has gone to sleep...” And that is how I  made the acquaintance of the little prince. It took me a  long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I  asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. The first time he saw my air-plane, for instance (I shall not draw my air-plane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: “What is that object?” “That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I  was proud to have him learn that I  could fly. He cried out, then: “What! You dropped down from the sky?” “Yes,” I  answered, modestly.</p>
