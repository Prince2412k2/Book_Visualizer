    <p>So then the seventh planet was the Earth. The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I  will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a  veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps. Seen from a  slight distance, that would make a  splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a  mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent. Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a  year. When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a  little from the truth. I  have not been altogether honest in what I  have told you about the lamplighters. And I  realise that I  run the risk of giving a  false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a  very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a  small Pacific islet. The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a  great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I  know, confidence in me. When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a  coil of gold, the colour of the moonlight, flashed across the sand. “Good evening,” said the little prince courteously. “Good evening,” said the snake. “What planet is this on which I  have come down?” asked the little prince. “This is the Earth; this is Africa,” the snake answered. “Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?”</p>
