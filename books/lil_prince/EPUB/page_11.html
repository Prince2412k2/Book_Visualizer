    <p>chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a  coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days. Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself. And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: “Ah! I  am scarcely awake. I  beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged...” But the little prince could not restrain his admiration: “Oh! How beautiful you are!” “Am I  not?” the flower responded, sweetly. “And I  was born at the same moment as the sun...” The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and exciting she was! “I think it is time for breakfast,” she added an instant later. “If you would have the kindness to think of my needs” And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a  sprinkling can of fresh water.

It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from...” But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a  seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong. “The screen?” “I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me...” Then she forced her cough a  little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy. “I ought not to have listened to her,” he confided to me one day. “One never ought to listen to the flowers.
