'even children\'s books. I have a third good excuse: this grown-up lives in\nFrance where he is hungry and cold. He needs to be comforted. If all\nthese excuses are not enough, I will then dedicate this book to the child\nwho became that grown-up. All grown-ups were first children. (But few\nof them remember it.) So I correct my dedication:\nTo Leon Werth\xa0\nwhen he was a little boy.\nI\nWhen I was six years old, I once saw a magnificent picture in a\nbook on the virgin forest called Stories of Life. It was a boa\nconstrictor that had swallowed a wild beast. Here is a copy of the\ndrawing.\nIt was written in the book, Boa constrictors swallow their whole\nprey without chewing. Then they can not move and they sleep\nduring the six months of their digestion.\nI then thought a lot about the adventures of the jungle and, in turn,\nsucceeded, with a colored pencil, in drawing my very first drawing.\nIt was like this:\nI showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked them if my\ndrawing frightened them.\nThey said, Why would a hat be scary?\nMy drawing was not of a hat. It was a boa constrictor digesting an\nelephant. I then drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the\ngrown-ups could understand. They always required more\nexplanation. My second drawing was like this:\nThe grown-ups advised me to leave aside the drawings of boa\nconstrictors from the outside or the inside, and to interest myself\ninstead in geography, history, calculation, and grammar. Thus, at\nthe age of six, I abandoned a magnificent career as a painter. I had\nbeen discouraged by the failure of my first drawing and my second\ndrawing. Grown-ups never understand anything on their own, and\nit is tiring for children to always have to give them explanations.\nSo I had to choose another profession. I learned to fly planes. I flew\nall over the world. And geography, that\'s right, served me well. I\nknew how to recognize, at first glance, China, or Arizona. It is\nuseful if you have gone astray during the night.\nI have had, in the course of my life, a lot of contact with many\nserious people. I have lived among the grown-ups. I saw them up\nclose. It did not really improve my opinion of them.\nWhen I met one that seemed to me a little lucid, I had them\nexperience my drawing number 1, which I had preserved. I wanted\nto know if they could come to a real understanding. But they\nalways replied: It\'s a hat. After that I spoke to them neither of boa\nconstrictors, nor of virgin forests, nor of stars. I put myself within\ntheir reach. I talked about bridge, golf, politics, and ties. And the\ngrown-ups were glad to know such a reasonable man.\nII\nSo I lived alone, with no one to talk to, until a breakdown in the\nSahara desert six years ago. Something had broken in my engine.\nAnd since I had neither a mechanic nor a passenger with me, I\nprepared to try, by myself, to make a difficult reprieve. It was a\nmatter of life and death. I had hardly any water to drink for a week.\nThe first night I fell asleep on the sand a thousand miles from any\ninhabited land. I was much more isolated than a castaway on a raft\nin the middle of the ocean. Then you imagine my surprise, at dawn,\nwhen a funny little voice woke me up. She said:\n" Please draw me a sheep !\n- Hein!\n- Draw me a sheepâ€¦ "\nI jumped on my feet as if I had been struck by lightning. I rubbed\n[img-1]'
