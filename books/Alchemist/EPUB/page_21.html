    <p>Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. "I'm like everyone else — I se e the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does." He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man. "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it," he had said. The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy's past. "They're called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens."

He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He didn't consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned that there were certain things one shouldn't ask about, so as not to flee from one's own destiny. "I promised that I would make my own decisions," he said to himself. But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn't a strange place; it was a new one. After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he 22</p>
