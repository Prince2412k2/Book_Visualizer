A poignant encounter between a pilot and a young prince in the vast desert : A serene desert landscape at sunset, with a small well in the distance, surrounded by a few palm trees and a ruined stone wall. In the foreground, a pilot is sitting next to a small, golden-haired prince, who is dressed in a simple white suit and is holding a small, delicate rose. The prince's eyes are cast downward, and his face is filled with a mix of sadness and longing. The pilot's face is etched with concern and compassion. The sky above is a deep shade of blue, with a few stars beginning to twinkle in the distance. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of a gentle breeze rustling through the palm trees. In the background, a small, yellow snake is slithering through the sand, its eyes fixed intently on the prince. The atmosphere is one of melancholy and longing, as the prince prepares to leave the pilot and return to his own planet. The pilot's hand is gently holding the prince's, as if trying to comfort him in his final moments. The scene is bathed in a warm, golden light, with the setting sun casting a long shadow across the desert floor.
