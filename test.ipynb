      "\t - The narrator, Meursault, travels to Marengo to attend his mother's funeral. He meets the warden and the keeper, who explain the arrangements for the funeral. Meursault visits his mother's body in the mortuary and meets the old people who are keeping vigil with him. They are quiet and seem to be in a state of shock. Meursault is struck by their appearance and their behavior. The keeper brings them coffee and they drink it in silence. Meursault falls asleep and wakes up to find the old people sleeping. He wakes up again and sees the old men coughing and spitting. The keeper tells them it's time to leave and they all get up and shake hands with Meursault. The narrator reflects on the strange and uncomfortable atmosphere of the vigil. He then meets the warden, who explains that there will be a funeral procession to the church in the village. Meursault, the warden, and the nurse will be the only mourners. They are joined by old Pérez, who is overcome with emotion. The procession makes its way to the church, where the priest is waiting. The coffin is placed in the hearse and the procession sets off. Meursault is struck by the heat and the landscape. He notices that Pérez has a slight limp and is struggling to keep up. The procession continues until they reach the church, where the funeral service will take place. To be continued.\n",

      "Summary\n",
      "\t - The narrator, Meursault, travels to Marengo to attend his mother's funeral. He meets the warden and the keeper, who explain the arrangements for the funeral. Meursault visits his mother's body in the mortuary and meets the old people who are keeping vigil with him. They are quiet and seem to be in a state of shock. Meursault is struck by their appearance and their behavior. The keeper brings them coffee and they drink it in silence. Meursault falls asleep and wakes up to find the old people sleeping. He wakes up again and sees the old men coughing and spitting. The keeper tells them it's time to leave and they all get up and shake hands with Meursault. The narrator reflects on the strange and uncomfortable atmosphere of the vigil. He then meets the warden, who explains that there will be a funeral procession to the church in the village. Meursault, the warden, and the nurse will be the only mourners. They are joined by old Pérez, who is overcome with emotion. The procession makes its way to the church, where the priest is waiting. The coffin is placed in the hearse and the procession sets off. Meursault is struck by the heat and the landscape. He notices that Pérez has a slight limp and is struggling to keep up. The procession continues until they reach the church, where the funeral service will take place. To be continued.\n",

       "[PromptContentSchema(input_text='Part One I MOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I canâ\\x80\\x99t be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday. The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers. With the two oâ\\x80\\x99clock bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can spend the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by tomorrow evening. I have fixed up with my employer for two daysâ\\x80\\x99 leave; obviously, under the circumstances, he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t refuse. Still, I had an idea he looked annoyed, and I said, without thinking: â\\x80\\x9cSorry, sir, but itâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault, you know.â\\x80\\x9d Afterwards it struck me I neednâ\\x80\\x99t have said that. I had no reason to excuse myself; it was up to him to express his sympathy and so forth. Probably he will do so the day after tomorrow, when he sees me in black. For the present, itâ\\x80\\x99s almost as if Mother werenâ\\x80\\x99t really dead. The funeral will bring it home to me, put an official seal on it, so to speak.... I took the two-oâ\\x80\\x99clock bus. It was a blazing hot afternoon. Iâ\\x80\\x99d lunched, as usual, at CÃ©lesteâ\\x80\\x99s restaurant. Everyone was most kind, and CÃ©leste said to me, â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no one like a mother.â\\x80\\x9d When I left they came with me to the door. It was something of a rush, getting away, as at the last moment I had to call in at Emmanuelâ\\x80\\x99s place to borrow his black tie and mourning band. He lost his uncle a few months ago. I had to run to catch the bus. I suppose it was my hurrying like that, what with the glare off the road and from the sky, the reek of gasoline, and the jolts, that made me feel so drowsy. Anyhow, I slept most of the way. When I woke I was leaning against a soldier; he grinned and asked me if Iâ\\x80\\x99d come from a long way off, and I just nodded, to cut things short. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in a mood for talking. The Home is a little over a mile from the village. I went there on foot. I asked to be allowed to see Mother at once, but the doorkeeper told me I must see the warden first. He wasnâ\\x80\\x99t free, and I had to wait a bit. The doorkeeper chatted with me while I waited; then he led me to the office. The warden was a very small man, with gray hair, and a Legion of Honor rosette in his buttonhole. He gave me a long look with his watery blue eyes. Then we shook hands, and he held mine so long that I began to feel embarrassed. After that he consulted a register on his table, and said: â\\x80\\x9cMadame Meursault entered the Home three years ago. She had no private means and depended entirely on you.â\\x80\\x9d I had a feeling he was blaming me for something, and started to explain. But he cut me short. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no need to excuse yourself, my boy. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve looked up the record and obviously you werenâ\\x80\\x99t in a position to see that she was properly cared for. She needed someone to be with her all the time, and young men in jobs like yours donâ\\x80\\x99t get too much pay. In any case, she was much happier in the Home.â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir; Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of that.â\\x80\\x9d Then he added: â\\x80\\x9cShe had good friends here, you know, old folks like herself, and one gets on better with people of oneâ\\x80\\x99s own generation. Youâ\\x80\\x99re much too young; you couldnâ\\x80\\x99t have been much of a companion to her.â\\x80\\x9d That was so. When we lived together, Mother was always watching me, but we hardly ever talked. During her first few weeks at the Home she used to cry a good deal. But that was only because she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t settled down. After a month or two sheâ\\x80\\x99d have cried if sheâ\\x80\\x99d been told to leave the Home. Because this, too, would have been a wrench. That was why, during the last year, I seldom went to see her. Also, it would have meant losing my Sunday â\\x80\\x94not to mention the trouble of going to the bus, getting my ticket, and spending two hours on the journey each way. The warden went on talking, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t pay much attention. Finally he said: â\\x80\\x9cNow, I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99d like to see your mother?â\\x80\\x9d I rose without replying, and he led the way to the door. As we were going down the stairs he explained: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve had the body moved to our little mortuaryâ\\x80\\x94so as not to upset the other old people, you understand. Every time thereâ\\x80\\x99s a death here, theyâ\\x80\\x99re in a nervous state for two or three days. Which means, of course, extra work and worry for our staff.â\\x80\\x9d We crossed a courtyard where there were a number of old men, talking amongst themselves in little groups. They fell silent as we came up with them. Then, behind our backs, the chattering began again. Their voices reminded me of parakeets in a cage, only the sound wasnâ\\x80\\x99t quite so shrill. The warden stopped outside the entrance of a small, low building. â\\x80\\x9cSo here I leave you, Monsieur Meursault. If you want me for anything, youâ\\x80\\x99ll find me in my office. We propose to have the funeral tomorrow morning. That will enable you to spend the night beside your motherâ\\x80\\x99s coffin, as no doubt you would wish to do. Just one more thing; I gathered from your motherâ\\x80\\x99s friends that she wished to be buried with the rites of the Church. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made arrangements for this; but I thought I should let you know.â\\x80\\x9d I thanked him. So far as I knew, my mother, though not a professed atheist, had never given a thought to religion in her life. I entered the mortuary. It was a bright, spotlessly clean room, with whitewashed walls and a big skylight. The furniture consisted of some chairs and trestles. Two of the latter stood open in the center of the room and the coffin rested on them. The lid was in place, but the screws had been given only a few turns and their nickeled heads stuck out above the wood, which was stained dark walnut. An Arab womanâ\\x80\\x94a nurse, I supposedâ\\x80\\x94 was sitting beside the bier; she was wearing a blue smock and had a rather gaudy scarf wound round her hair. Just then the keeper came up behind me. Heâ\\x80\\x99d evidently been running, as he was a little out of breath. â\\x80\\x9cWe put the lid on, but I was told to unscrew it when you came, so that you could see her.â\\x80\\x9d While he was going up to the coffin I told him not to trouble. â\\x80\\x9cEh? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s that?â\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t want me to...?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I said. He put back the screwdriver in his pocket and stared at me. I realized then that I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have said, â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d and it made me rather embarrassed. After eying me for some moments he asked: â\\x80\\x9cWhy not?â\\x80\\x9d But he didnâ\\x80\\x99t sound reproachful; he simply wanted to know. â\\x80\\x9cWell, really I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t say,â\\x80\\x9d I answered. He began twiddling his white mustache; then, without looking at me, said gently: â\\x80\\x9cI understand.â\\x80\\x9d He was a pleasant-looking man, with blue eyes and ruddy cheeks. He drew up a chair for me near the coffin, and seated himself just behind. The nurse got up and moved toward the door. As she was going by, the keeper whispered in my ear: â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a tumor she has, poor thing.â\\x80\\x9d I looked at her more carefully and I noticed that she had a bandage round her head, just below her eyes. It lay quite flat across the bridge of her nose, and one saw hardly anything of her face except that strip of whiteness. As soon as she had gone, the keeper rose. â\\x80\\x9cNow Iâ\\x80\\x99ll leave you to yourself.â\\x80\\x9d I donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether I made some gesture, but instead of going he halted behind my chair. The sensation of someone posted at my back made me uncomfortable. The sun was getting low and the whole room was flooded with a pleasant, mellow light. Two hornets were buzzing overhead, against the skylight. I was so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. Without looking round, I asked the keeper how long heâ\\x80\\x99d been at the Home. â\\x80\\x9cFive years.â\\x80\\x9d The answer came so pat that one could have thought heâ\\x80\\x99d been expecting my question. That started him off, and he became quite chatty. If anyone had told him ten years ago that heâ\\x80\\x99d end his days as doorkeeper at a home at Marengo, heâ\\x80\\x99d never have believed it. He was sixty-four, he said, and hailed from Paris. When he said that, I broke in. â\\x80\\x9cAh, you donâ\\x80\\x99t come from here?â\\x80\\x9d I remembered then that, before taking me to the warden, heâ\\x80\\x99d told me something about Mother. He had said sheâ\\x80\\x99d have to be buried mighty quickly because of the heat in these parts, especially down in the plain. â\\x80\\x9cAt Paris they keep the body for three days, sometimes four.â\\x80\\x9d After that he had mentioned that heâ\\x80\\x99d spent the best part of his life in Paris, and could never manage to forget it. â\\x80\\x9cHere,â\\x80\\x9d he had said, â\\x80\\x9cthings have to go with a rush, like. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve hardly time to get used to the idea that someoneâ\\x80\\x99s dead, before youâ\\x80\\x99re hauled off to the funeral.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s enough,â\\x80\\x9d his wife had put in. â\\x80\\x9cYou didnâ\\x80\\x99t ought to say such things to the poor young gentleman.â\\x80\\x9d The old fellow had blushed and begun to apologize. I told him it was quite all right. As a matter of fact, I found it rather interesting, what heâ\\x80\\x99d been telling me; I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t thought of that before. Now he went on to say that heâ\\x80\\x99d entered the Home as an ordinary inmate. But he was still quite hale and hearty, and when the keeperâ\\x80\\x99s job fell vacant, he offered to take it on. I pointed out that, even so, he was really an inmate like the others, but he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of it. He was â\\x80\\x9can official, like.â\\x80\\x9d Iâ\\x80\\x99d been struck before by his habit of saying â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x9d or, less often, â\\x80\\x9cthem old folks,â\\x80\\x9d when referring to inmates no older than himself. Still, I could see his point of view. As doorkeeper he had a certain standing, and some authority over the rest of them. Just then the nurse returned. Night had fallen very quickly; all of a sudden, it seemed, the sky went black above the skylight. The keeper switched on the lamps, and I was almost blinded by the blaze of light. He suggested I should go to the refectory for dinner, but I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t hungry. Then he proposed bringing me a mug of cafÃ© au lait. As I am very partial to cafÃ© au lait I said, â\\x80\\x9cThanks,â\\x80\\x9d and a few minutes later he came back with a tray. I drank the coffee, and then I wanted a cigarette. But I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sure if I should smoke, under the circumstancesâ\\x80\\x94in Motherâ\\x80\\x99s presence. I thought it over; really, it didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to matter, so I offered the keeper a cigarette, and we both smoked. After a while he started talking again. â\\x80\\x9cYou know, your motherâ\\x80\\x99s friends will be coming soon, to keep vigil with you beside the body. We always have a â\\x80\\x98vigilâ\\x80\\x99 here, when anyone dies. Iâ\\x80\\x99d better go and get some chairs and a pot of black coffee.â\\x80\\x9d The glare off the white walls was making my eyes smart, and I asked him if he couldnâ\\x80\\x99t turn off one of the lamps. â\\x80\\x9cNothing doing,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Theyâ\\x80\\x99d arranged the lights like that; either one had them all on or none at all. After that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t pay much more attention to him. He went out, brought some chairs, and set them out round the coffin. On one he placed a coffeepot and ten or a dozen cups. Then he sat down facing me, on the far side of Mother. The nurse was at the other end of the room, with her back to me. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see what she was doing, but by the way her arms moved I guessed that she was knitting. I was feeling very comfortable; the coffee had warmed me up, and through the open door came scents of flowers and breaths of cool night air. I think I dozed off for a while. I was wakened by an odd rustling in my ears. After having had my eyes closed, I had a feeling that the light had grown even stronger than before. There wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a trace of shadow anywhere, and every object, each curve or angle, seemed to score its outline on oneâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. The old people, Motherâ\\x80\\x99s friends, were coming in. I counted ten in all, gliding almost soundlessly through the bleak white glare. None of the chairs creaked when they sat down. Never in my life had I seen anyone so clearly as I saw these people; not a detail of their clothes or features escaped me. And yet I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear them, and it was hard to believe they really existed. Nearly all the women wore aprons, and the strings drawn tight round their waists made their big stomachs bulge still more. Iâ\\x80\\x99d never yet noticed what big paunches old women usually have. Most of the men, however, were as thin as rakes, and they all carried sticks. What struck me most about their faces was that one couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see their eyes, only a dull glow in a sort of nest of wrinkles. On sitting down, they looked at me, and wagged their heads awkwardly, their lips sucked in between their toothless gums. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t decide if they were greeting me and trying to say something, or if it was due to some infirmity of age. I inclined to think that they were greeting me, after their fashion, but it had a queer effect, seeing all those old fellows grouped round the keeper, solemnly eying me and dandling their heads from side to side. For a moment I had an absurd impression that they had come to sit in judgment on me. A few minutes later one of the women started weeping. She was in the second row and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see her face because of another woman in front. At regular intervals she emitted a little choking sob; one had a feeling she would never stop. The others didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to notice. They sat in silence, slumped in their chairs, staring at the coffin or at their walking sticks or any object just in front of them, and never took their eyes off it. And still the woman sobbed. I was rather surprised, as I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know who she was. I wanted her to stop crying, but dared not speak to her. After a while the keeper bent toward her and whispered in her ear; but she merely shook her head, mumbled something I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t catch, and went on sobbing as steadily as before. The keeper got up and moved his chair beside mine. At first he kept silent; then, without looking at me, he explained. â\\x80\\x9cShe was devoted to your mother. She says your mother was her only friend in the world, and now sheâ\\x80\\x99s all alone.â\\x80\\x9d I had nothing to say, and the silence lasted quite a while. Presently the womanâ\\x80\\x99s sighs and sobs became less frequent, and, after blowing her nose and snuffling for some minutes, she, too, fell silent. Iâ\\x80\\x99d ceased feeling sleepy, but I was very tired and my legs were aching badly. And now I realized that the silence of these people was telling on my nerves. The only sound was a rather queer one; it came only now and then, and at first I was puzzled by it. However, after listening attentively, I guessed what it was; the old men were sucking at the insides of their cheeks, and this caused the odd, wheezing noises that had mystified me. They were so much absorbed in their thoughts that they didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what they were up to. I even had an impression that the dead body in their midst meant nothing at all to them. But now I suspect that I was mistaken about this. We all drank the coffee, which the keeper handed round. After that, I canâ\\x80\\x99t remember much; somehow the night went by. I can recall only one moment; I had opened my eyes and I saw the old men sleeping hunched up on their chairs, with one exception. Resting his chin on his hands clasped round his stick, he was staring hard at me, as if he had been waiting for me to wake. Then I fell asleep again. I woke up after a bit, because the ache in my legs had developed into a sort of cramp. There was a glimmer of dawn above the skylight. A minute or two later one of the old men woke up and coughed repeatedly. He spat into a big check handkerchief, and each time he spat it sounded as if he were retching. This woke the others, and the keeper told them it was time to make a move. They all got up at once. Their faces were ashen gray after the long, uneasy vigil. To my surprise each of them shook hands with me, as though this night together, in which we hadnâ\\x80\\x99t exchanged a word, had created a kind of intimacy between us. I was quite done in. The keeper took me to his room, and I tidied myself up a bit. He gave me some more â\\x80\\x9cwhiteâ\\x80\\x9d coffee, and it seemed to do me good. When I went out, the sun was up and the sky mottled red above the hills between Marengo and the sea. A morning breeze was blowing and it had a pleasant salty tang. There was the promise of a very fine day. I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been in the country for ages, and I caught myself thinking what an agreeable walk I could have had, if it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for Mother. As it was, I waited in the courtyard, under a plane tree. I sniffed the smells of the cool earth and found I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t sleepy any more. Then I thought of the other fellows in the office. At this hour theyâ\\x80\\x99d be getting up, preparing to go to work; for me this was always the worst hour of the day. I went on thinking, like this, for ten minutes or so; then the sound of a bell inside the building attracted my attention. I could see movements behind the windows; then all was calm again. The sun had risen a little higher and was beginning to warm my feet. The keeper came across the yard and said the warden wished to see me. I went to his office and he got me to sign some document. I noticed that he was in black, with pin-stripe trousers. He picked up the telephone receiver and looked at me. â\\x80\\x9cThe undertakerâ\\x80\\x99s men arrived some moments ago, and they will be going to the mortuary to screw down the coffin. Shall I tell them to wait, for you to have a last glimpse of your mother?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d I said. He spoke into the receiver, lowering his voice. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s all right, Figeac. Tell the men to go there now.â\\x80\\x9d He then informed me that he was going to attend the funeral, and I thanked him. Sitting down behind his desk, he crossed his short legs and leaned back. Besides the nurse on duty, he told me, he and I would be the only mourners at the funeral. It was a rule of the Home that inmates shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t attend funerals, though there was no objection to letting some of them sit up beside the coffin, the night before. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s for their own sakes,â\\x80\\x9d he explained, â\\x80\\x9cto spare their feelings. But in this particular instance Iâ\\x80\\x99ve given permission to an old friend of your mother to come with us. His name is Thomas PÃ©rez.â\\x80\\x9d The warden smiled. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a rather touching little story in its way. He and your mother had become almost inseparable. The other old people used to tease PÃ©rez about having a fiancÃ©e. â\\x80\\x98When are you going to marry her?â\\x80\\x99 theyâ\\x80\\x99d ask. Heâ\\x80\\x99d turn it with a laugh. It was a standing joke, in fact. So, as you can guess, he feels very badly about your motherâ\\x80\\x99s death. I thought I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t decently refuse him permission to attend the funeral. But, on our medical officerâ\\x80\\x99s advice, I forbade him to sit up beside the body last night.â\\x80\\x9d For some time we sat there without speaking. Then the warden got up and went to the window. Presently he said: â\\x80\\x9cAh, thereâ\\x80\\x99s the padre from Marengo. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a bit ahead of time.â\\x80\\x9d He warned me that it would take us a good three quarters of an hour, walking to the church, which was in the village. Then we went downstairs. The priest was waiting just outside the mortuary door. With him were two acolytes, one of whom had a censer. The priest was stooping over him, adjusting the length of the silver chain on which it hung. When he saw us he straightened up and said a few words to me, addressing me as, â\\x80\\x9cMy son.â\\x80\\x9d Then he led the way into the mortuary. I noticed at once that four men in black were standing behind the coffin and the screws in the lid had now been driven home. At the same moment I heard the warden remark that the hearse had arrived, and the priest starting his prayers. Then everybody made a move. Holding a strip of black cloth, the four men approached the coffin, while the priest, the boys, and myself filed out. A lady I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen before was standing by the door. â\\x80\\x9cThis is Monsieur Meursault,â\\x80\\x9d the warden said to her. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t catch her name, but I gathered she was a nursing sister attached to the Home. When I was introduced, she bowed, without the trace of a smile on her long, gaunt face. We stood aside from the doorway to let the coffin by; then, following the bearers down a corridor, we came to the front entrance, where a hearse was waiting. Oblong, glossy, varnished black all over, it vaguely reminded me of the pen trays in the office. Beside the hearse stood a quaintly dressed little -man, whose duty it was, I understood, to supervise the funeral, as a sort of master of ceremonies. Near him, looking constrained, almost bashful, was old M. PÃ©rez, my motherâ\\x80\\x99s special friend. He wore a soft felt hat with a pudding-basin crown and a very wide brimâ\\x80\\x94he whisked it off the moment the coffin emerged from the doorwayâ\\x80\\x94trousers that concertinaâ\\x80\\x99d on his shoes, a black tie much too small for his high white double collar. Under a bulbous, pimply nose, his lips were trembling. But what caught my attention most was his ears; pendulous, scarlet ears that showed up like blobs of sealing wax on the pallor of his cheeks and were framed in wisps of silky white hair. The undertakerâ\\x80\\x99s factotum shepherded us to our places, with the priest in front of the hearse, and the four men in black on each side of it. The warden and myself came next, and, bringing up the rear, old PÃ©rez and the nurse. The sky was already a blaze of light, and the air stoking up rapidly. I felt the first waves of heat lapping my back, and my dark suit made things worse. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t imagine why we waited so long for getting under way. Old PÃ©rez, who had put on his hat, took it off again. I had turned slightly in his direction and was looking at him when the warden started telling me more about him. I remember his saying that old PÃ©rez and my mother used often to have a longish stroll together in the cool of the evening; sometimes they went as far as the village, accompanied by a nurse, of course. I looked at the countryside, at the long lines of cypresses sloping up toward the skyline and the hills, the hot red soil dappled with vivid green, and here and there a lonely house sharply outlined against the lightâ\\x80\\x94and I could understand Motherâ\\x80\\x99s feelings. Evenings in these parts must be a sort of mournful solace. Now, in the full glare of the morning sun, with everything shimmering in the heat haze, there was something inhuman, discouraging, about this landscape. At last we made a move. Only then I noticed that PÃ©rez had a slight limp. The old chap steadily lost ground as the hearse gained speed. One of the men beside it, too, fell back and drew level with me. I was surprised to see how quickly the sun was climbing up the sky, and just then it struck me that for quite a while the air had been throbbing with the hum of insects and the rustle of grass warming up. Sweat was running down my face. As I had no hat I tried to fan myself with my handkerchief. The undertakerâ\\x80\\x99s man turned to me and said something that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t catch. At that same time he wiped the crown of his head with a handkerchief that he held in his left hand, while with his right he tilted up his hat. I asked him what heâ\\x80\\x99d said. He pointed upward. â\\x80\\x9cSunâ\\x80\\x99s pretty bad today, ainâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I said. After a while he asked: â\\x80\\x9cIs it your mother weâ\\x80\\x99re burying?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d I said again. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was her age?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, she was getting on.â\\x80\\x9d As a matter of fact, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know exactly how old she was. After that he kept silent. Looking back, I saw PÃ©rez limping along some fifty yards behind. He was swinging his big felt hat at armâ\\x80\\x99s length, trying to make the pace. I also had a look at the', character_list={'Meursault': \"The narrator, a young man who is attending his mother's funeral.\", 'Warden': 'The warden of the Home for Aged Persons, who is responsible for organizing the funeral.', 'Keeper': 'The keeper of the Home, who is in charge of the mortuary and the old people.', 'Pérez': \"An old man who was a close friend of Meursault's mother and is attending the funeral.\", 'Nurse': 'A nurse who is working at the Home and is attending the funeral.'}, places_list={'Marengo': \"A village in the countryside where Meursault's mother is being buried.\", 'Home for Aged Persons': \"A home where Meursault's mother lived and where the funeral is being held.\", 'Mortuary': \"A room in the Home where Meursault's mother's body is being kept.\", 'Church': 'A church in the village where the funeral service will take place.'}),\n",
       " PromptContentSchema(input_text=' warden. He was walking with carefully measured steps, economizing every gesture. Beads of perspiration glistened on his forehead, but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t wipe them off. I had an impression that our little procession was moving slightly faster. Wherever I looked I saw the same sun-drenched countryside, and the sky was so dazzling that I dared not raise my eyes. Presently we struck a patch of freshly tarred road. A shimmer of heat played over it and oneâ\\x80\\x99s feet squelched at each step, leaving bright black gashes. In front, the coachmanâ\\x80\\x99s glossy black hat looked like a lump of the same sticky substance, poised above the hearse. It gave one a queer, dreamlike impression, that blue-white glare overhead and all this blackness round one: the sleek black of the hearse, the dull black of the menâ\\x80\\x99s clothes, and the silvery-black gashes in the road. And then there were the smells, smells of hot leather and horse dung from the hearse, veined with whiffs of incense smoke. What with these and the hangover from a poor nightâ\\x80\\x99s sleep, I found my eyes and thoughts growing blurred. I looked back again. PÃ©rez seemed very far away now, almost hidden by the heat haze; then, abruptly, he disappeared altogether. After puzzling over it for a bit, I guessed that he had turned off the road into the fields. Then I noticed that there was a bend of the road a little way ahead. Obviously PÃ©rez, who knew the district well, had taken a short cut, so as to catch up with us. He rejoined us soon after we were round the bend; then began to lose ground again. He took another short cut and met us again farther on; in fact, this happened several times during the next half-hour. But soon I lost interest in his movements; my temples were throbbing and I could hardly drag myself along. After that everything went with a rush; and also with such precision and matter-of-factness that I remember hardly any details. Except that when we were on the outskirts of the village the nurse said something to me. Her voice took me by surprise; it didnâ\\x80\\x99t match her face at all; it was musical and slightly tremulous. What she said was: â\\x80\\x9cIf you go too slowly thereâ\\x80\\x99s the risk of a heatstroke. But, if you go too fast, you perspire, and the cold air in the church gives you a chill.â\\x80\\x9d I saw her point; either way one was in for it. Some other memories of the funeral have stuck in my mind. The old boyâ\\x80\\x99s face, for instance, when he caught up with us for the last time, just outside the village. His eyes were streaming with tears, of exhaustion or distress, or both together. But because of the wrinkles they couldnâ\\x80\\x99t flow down. They spread out, crisscrossed, and formed a smooth gloss on the old, worn face. And I can remember the look of the church, the villagers in the street, the red geraniums on the graves, PÃ©rezâ\\x80\\x99s fainting fitâ\\x80\\x94he crumpled up like a rag dollâ\\x80\\x94the tawny-red earth pattering on Motherâ\\x80\\x99s coffin, the bits of white roots mixed up with it; then more people, voices, the wait outside a cafÃ© for the bus, the rumble of the engine, and my little thrill of pleasure when we entered the first brightly lit streets of Algiers, and I pictured myself going straight to bed and sleeping twelve hours at a stretch. II ON WAKING I understood why my employer had looked rather cross when I asked for my two days off; itâ\\x80\\x99s a Saturday today. I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t thought of this at the time; it only struck me when I was getting out of bed. Obviously he had seen that it would mean my getting four daysâ\\x80\\x99 holiday straight off, and one couldnâ\\x80\\x99t expect him to like that. Still, for one thing, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t my fault if Mother was buried yesterday and not today; and then, again, Iâ\\x80\\x99d have had my Saturday and Sunday off in any case. But naturally this didnâ\\x80\\x99t prevent me from seeing my employerâ\\x80\\x99s point. Getting up was an effort, as Iâ\\x80\\x99d been really exhausted by the previous dayâ\\x80\\x99s experiences. While shaving, I wondered how to spend the morning, and decided that a swim would do me good. So I caught the streetcar that goes down to the harbor. It was quite like old times; a lot of young people were in the swimming pool, amongst them Marie Cardona, who used to be a typist at the office. I was rather keen on her in those days, and I fancy she liked me, too. But she was with us so short a time that nothing came of it. While I was helping her to climb on to a raft, I let my hand stray over her breasts. Then she lay flat on the raft, while I trod water. After a moment she turned and looked at me. Her hair was over her eyes and she was laughing. I clambered up on to the raft, beside her. The air was pleasantly warm, and, half jokingly, I let my head sink back upon her lap. She didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to mind, so I let it stay there. I had the sky full in my eyes, all blue and gold, and I could feel Marieâ\\x80\\x99s stomach rising and falling gently under my head. We must have stayed a good half-hour on the raft, both of us half asleep. When the sun got too hot she dived off and I followed. I caught up with her, put my arm round her waist, and we swam side by side. She was still laughing. While we were drying ourselves on the edge of the swimming pool she said: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m browner than you.â\\x80\\x9d I asked her if sheâ\\x80\\x99d come to the movies with', character_list={'Meursault': \"The narrator, a young man who is attending his mother's funeral.

Still, for one thing, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t my fault if Mother was buried yesterday and not today; and then, again, Iâ\\x80\\x99d have had my Saturday and Sunday off in any case. But naturally this didnâ\\x80\\x99t prevent me from seeing my employerâ\\x80\\x99s point. Getting up was an effort, as Iâ\\x80\\x99d been really exhausted by the previous dayâ\\x80\\x99s experiences. While shaving, I wondered how to spend the morning, and decided that a swim would do me good. So I caught the streetcar that goes down to the harbor. It was quite like old times; a lot of young people were in the swimming pool, amongst them Marie Cardona, who used to be a typist at the office. I was rather keen on her in those days, and I fancy she liked me, too. But she was with us so short a time that nothing came of it. While I was helping her to climb on to a raft, I let my hand stray over her breasts. Then she lay flat on the raft, while I trod water. After a moment she turned and looked at me. Her hair was over her eyes and she was laughing. I clambered up on to the raft, beside her. The air was pleasantly warm, and, half jokingly, I let my head sink back upon her lap. She didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to mind, so I let it stay there. I had the sky full in my eyes, all blue and gold, and I could feel Marieâ\\x80\\x99s stomach rising and falling gently under my head. We must have stayed a good half-hour on the raft, both of us half asleep. When the sun got too hot she dived off and I followed. I caught up with her, put my arm round her waist, and we swam side by side. She was still laughing. While we were drying ourselves on the edge of the swimming pool she said: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m browner than you.â\\x80\\x9d I asked her if sheâ\\x80\\x99d come to the movies with me that evening. She laughed again and said, â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d if Iâ\\x80\\x99d take her to the comedy everybody was talking about, the one with Fernandel in it. When we had dressed, she stared at my black tie and asked if I was in mourning. I explained that my mother had died. â\\x80\\x9cWhen?â\\x80\\x9d she asked, and I said, â\\x80\\x9cYesterday.â\\x80\\x9d She made no remark, though I thought she shrank away a little. I was just going to explain to her that it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t my fault, but I checked myself, as I remembered having said the same thing to my employer, and realizing then it sounded rather foolish. Still, foolish or not, somehow one canâ\\x80\\x99t help feeling a bit guilty, I suppose. Anyhow, by evening Marie had forgotten all about it. The film was funny in parts, but some of it was downright stupid. She pressed her leg against mine while we were in the picture house, and I was fondling her breast. Toward the end of the show I kissed her, but rather clumsily. Afterward she came back with me to my place. When I woke up, Marie had gone. Sheâ\\x80\\x99d told me her aunt expected her first thing in the morning. I remembered it was a Sunday, and that put me off; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never cared for Sundays. So I turned my head and lazily sniffed the smell of brine that Marieâ\\x80\\x99s head had left on the pillow. I slept until ten. After that I stayed in bed until noon, smoking cigarettes. I decided not to lunch at CÃ©lesteâ\\x80\\x99s restaurant as I usually did; theyâ\\x80\\x99d be sure to pester me with questions, and I dislike being questioned. So I fried some eggs and ate them off the pan. I did without bread as there wasnâ\\x80\\x99t any left, and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be bothered going down to buy it. After lunch I felt at loose ends and roamed about the little flat. It suited us well enough when Mother was with me, but now that I was by myself it was too large and Iâ\\x80\\x99d moved the dining table into my bedroom. That was now the only room I used; it had all the furniture I needed: a brass bedstead, a dressing table, some cane chairs whose seats had more or less caved in, a wardrobe with a tarnished mirror. The rest of the flat was never used, so I didnâ\\x80\\x99t trouble to look after it. A bit later, for want of anything better to do, I picked up an old newspaper that was lying on the floor and read it. There was an advertisement of Kruschen Salts and I cut it out and pasted in into an album where I keep things that amuse me in the papers. Then I washed my hands and, as a last resource, went out on to the balcony. My bedroom overlooks the main street of our district. Though it was a fine afternoon, the paving blocks were black and glistening. What few people were about seemed in an absurd hurry. First of all there came a family, going for their Sunday-afternoon walk; two small boys in sailor suits, with short trousers hardly down to their knees, and looking rather uneasy in their Sunday best; then a little girl with a big pink bow and black patent-leather shoes. Behind them was their mother, an enormously fat woman in a brown silk dress, and their father, a dapper little man, whom I knew by sight. He had a straw hat, a walking stick, and a butterfly tie. Seeing him beside his wife, I understood why people said he came of a good family and had married beneath him. Next came a group of young fellows, the local â\\x80\\x9cbloods,â\\x80\\x9d with sleek oiled hair, red ties, coats cut very tight at the waist, braided pockets, and square- toed shoes. I guessed they were going to one of the big theaters in the center of the town. That was why they had started out so early and were hurrying to the streetcar stop, laughing and talking at the top of their voices. After they had passed, the street gradually emptied. By this time all the matinees must have begun. Only a few shopkeepers and cats remained about. Above the sycamores bordering the road the sky was cloudless, but the light was soft. The tobacconist on the other side of the street brought a chair out on to the pavement in front of his door and sat astride it, resting his arms on the back. The streetcars which a few minutes before had been crowded were now almost empty. In the little cafÃ©, Chez Pierrot, beside the tobacconistâ\\x80\\x99s, the waiter was sweeping up the sawdust in the empty restaurant. A typical Sunday afternoon.... I turned my chair round and seated myself like the tobacconist, as it was more comfortable that way. After smoking a couple of cigarettes I went back to the room, got a tablet of chocolate, and returned to the window to eat it. Soon after, the sky clouded over, and I thought a summer storm was coming. However, the clouds gradually lifted. All the same, they had left in the street a sort of threat of rain, which made it darker. I stayed watching the sky for quite a while. At five there was a loud clanging of streetcars. They were coming from the stadium in our suburb where there had been a football match. Even the back platforms were crowded and people were standing on the steps. Then another streetcar brought back the teams. I knew they were the players by the little suitcase each man carried. They were bawling out their team song, â\\x80\\x9cKeep the ball rolling, boys.â\\x80\\x9d One of them looked up at me and shouted, â\\x80\\x9cWe licked them!â\\x80\\x9d I waved my hand and called back, â\\x80\\x9cGood work!â\\x80\\x9d From now on there was a steady stream of private cars. The sky had changed again; a reddish glow was spreading up beyond the housetops. As dusk set in, the street grew more crowded. People were returning from their walks, and I noticed the dapper little man with the fat wife amongst the passers-by. Children were whimpering and trailing wearily after their parents. After some minutes the local picture houses disgorged their audiences. I noticed that the young fellows coming from them were taking longer strides and gesturing more vigorously than at ordinary times; doubtless the picture theyâ\\x80\\x99d been seeing was of the wild- West variety. Those who had been to the picture houses in the middle of the town came a little later, and looked more sedate, though a few were still laughing. On the whole, however, they seemed languid and exhausted. Some of them remained loitering in the street under my window. A group of girls came by, walking arm in arm. The young men under my window swerved so as to brush against them, and shouted humorous remarks, which made the girls turn their heads and giggle. I recognized them as girls from my part of the town, and two or three of them, whom I knew, looked up and waved to me. Just then the street lamps came on, all together, and they made the stars that were beginning to glimmer in the night sky paler still. I felt my eyes getting tired, what with the lights and all the movement Iâ\\x80\\x99d been watching in the street. There were little pools of brightness under the lamps, and now and then a streetcar passed, lighting up a girlâ\\x80\\x99s hair, or a smile, or a silver bangle. Soon after this, as the streetcars became fewer and the sky showed velvety black above the trees and lamps, the street grew emptier, almost imperceptibly, until a time came when there was nobody to be seen and a cat, the first of the evening, crossed, unhurrying, the deserted street. It struck me that Iâ\\x80\\x99d better see about some dinner. I had been leaning so long on the back of my chair, looking down, that my neck hurt when I straightened myself up. I went down, bought some bread and spaghetti, did my cooking, and ate my meal standing. Iâ\\x80\\x99d intended to smoke another cigarette at my window, but the night had turned rather chilly and I decided against it. As I was coming back, after shutting the window, I glanced at the mirror and saw reflected in it a corner of my table with my spirit lamp and some bits of bread beside it. It occurred to me that somehow Iâ\\x80\\x99d got through another Sunday, that Mother now was buried, and tomorrow Iâ\\x80\\x99d be going back to work as usual. Really, nothing in my life had changed. III I HAD a busy morning in the office. My employer was in a good humor. He even inquired if I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t too tired, and followed it up by asking what Motherâ\\x80\\x99s age was. I thought a bit, then answered, â\\x80\\x9cRound about sixty,â\\x80\\x9d as I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to make a blunder. At which he looked relievedâ\\x80\\x94why, I canâ\\x80\\x99t imagineâ\\x80\\x94and seemed to think that closed the matter. There was a pile of bills of lading waiting on my desk, and I had to go through them all. Before leaving for lunch I washed my hands. I always enjoyed doing this at midday. In the evening it was less pleasant, as the roller towel, after being used by so many people, was sopping wet. I once brought this to my employerâ\\x80\\x99s notice. It was regrettable, he agreedâ\\x80\\x94but, to his mind, a mere detail. I left the office building a little later than usual, at half-past twelve, with Emmanuel, who works in the Forwarding Department. Our building overlooks the sea, and we paused for a moment on the steps to look at the shipping in the. harbor. The sun was scorching hot. Just then a big truck came up, with a din of chains and backfires from the engine, and Emmanuel suggested we should try to jump it. I started to run. The truck was well away, and we had to chase it for quite a distance. What with the heat and the noise from the engine, I felt half dazed. All I was conscious of was our mad rush along the water front, amongst cranes and winches, with dark hulls of ships alongside and masts swaying in the offing. I was the first to catch up with the truck. I took a flying jump, landed safely, and helped Emmanuel to scramble in beside me. We were both of us out of breath, and the bumps of the truck on the roughly laid cobbles made things worse. Emmanuel chuckled, and panted in my ear, â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve made it!â\\x80\\x9d By the time we reached CÃ©lesteâ\\x80\\x99s restaurant we were dripping with sweat.

I ate very quickly and had some coffee to finish up. Then I went to my place and took a short nap, as Iâ\\x80\\x99d drunk a glass of wine too many. When I woke I smoked a cigarette before getting off my bed. I was a bit late and had to run for the streetcar. The office was stifling, and I was kept hard at it all the afternoon. So it came as a relief when we closed down and I was strolling slowly along the wharves in the coolness. The sky was green, and it was pleasant to be out-of-doors after the stuffy office. However, I went straight home, as I had to put some potatoes on to boil. The hall was dark and, when I was starting up the stairs, I almost bumped into old Salamano, who lived on the same floor as I. As usual, he had his dog with him. For eight years the two had been inseparable. Salamanoâ\\x80\\x99s spaniel is an ugly brute, afflicted with some skin diseaseâ\\x80\\x94mange, I suspect; anyhow, it has lost all its hair and its body is covered with brown scabs. Perhaps through living in one small room, cooped up with his dog, Salamano has come to resemble it. His towy hair has gone very thin, and he has reddish blotches on his face. And the dog has developed something of its masterâ\\x80\\x99s queer hunched-up gait; it always has its muzzle stretched far forward and its nose to the ground. But, oddly enough, though so much alike, they detest each other. Twice a day, at eleven and six, the old fellow takes his dog for a walk, and for eight years that walk has never varied. You can see them in the rue de Lyon, the dog pulling his master along as hard as he can, till finally the old chap misses a step and nearly falls. Then he beats his dog and calls it names. The dog cowers and lags behind, and itâ\\x80\\x99s his masterâ\\x80\\x99s turn to drag him along. Presently the dog forgets, starts tugging at the leash again, gets another hiding and more abuse. Then they halt on the pavement, the pair of them, and glare at each other; the dog with terror and the man with hatred in his eyes. Every time theyâ\\x80\\x99re out, this happens. When the dog wants to stop at a lamppost, the old boy wonâ\\x80\\x99t let him, and drags him on, and the wretched spaniel leaves behind him a trail of little drops. But, if he does it in the room, it means another hiding. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been going on like this for eight years, and CÃ©leste always says itâ\\x80\\x99s a â\\x80\\x9ccrying shame,â\\x80\\x9d and something should be done about it; but really one canâ\\x80\\x99t be sure. When I met him in the hall, Salamano was bawling at his dog, calling him a bastard, a lousy mongrel, and so forth, and the dog was whining. I said, â\\x80\\x9cGood evening,â\\x80\\x9d but the old fellow took no notice and went on cursing. So I thought Iâ\\x80\\x99d ask him what the dog had done. Again, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t answer, but went on shouting, â\\x80\\x9cYou bloody cur!â\\x80\\x9d and the rest of it. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see very clearly, but he seemed to be fixing something on the dogâ\\x80\\x99s collar. I raised my voice a little. Without looking round, he mumbled in a sort of suppressed fury: â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s always in the way, blast him!â\\x80\\x9d Then he started up the stairs, but the dog tried to resist and flattened itself out on the floor, so he had to haul it up on the leash, step by step. Just then another man who lives on my floor came in from the street. The general idea hereabouts is that heâ\\x80\\x99s a pimp. But if you ask him what his job is, he says heâ\\x80\\x99s a warehouseman. One thingâ\\x80\\x99s sure: he isnâ\\x80\\x99t popular in our street. Still, he often has a word for me, and drops in sometimes for a short talk in my room, because I listen to him. As a matter of fact, I find what he says quite interesting. So, really Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no reason for freezing him off. His name is SintÃ ̈s; Raymond SintÃ ̈s. Heâ\\x80\\x99s short and thick-set, has a nose like a boxerâ\\x80\\x99s, and always dresses very sprucely. He, too, once said to me, referring to Salamano, that it was â\\x80\\x9ca damned shame,â\\x80\\x9d and asked me if I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t disgusted by the way the old man served his dog. I answered: â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d We went up the stairs together, SintÃ ̈s and I, and when I was turning in at my door, he said: â\\x80\\x9cLook here! How about having some grub with me? Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a black pudding and some wine.â\\x80\\x9d It struck me that this would save my having to cook my dinner, so I said, â\\x80\\x9cThanks very much.â\\x80\\x9d He, too, has only one room, and a little kitchen without a window. I saw a pink-and-white plaster angel above his bed, and some photos of sporting champions and naked girls pinned to the opposite wall. The bed hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been made and the room was dirty. He began by lighting a paraffin lamp; then fumbled in his pocket and produced a rather grimy bandage, which he wrapped round his right hand. I asked him what the trouble was. He told me heâ\\x80\\x99d been having a roughhouse with a fellow whoâ\\x80\\x99d annoyed him. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not one who looks for trouble,â\\x80\\x9d he explained, â\\x80\\x9conly Iâ\\x80\\x99m a bit short- tempered. That fellow said to me, challenging-like, â\\x80\\x98Come down off that streetcar, if youâ\\x80\\x99re a man.â\\x80\\x99 I says, â\\x80\\x98You keep quiet, I ainâ\\x80\\x99t done nothing to you.â\\x80\\x99 Then he said I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t any guts. Well, that settled it. I got down off the streetcar and I said to him, â\\x80\\x98You better keep your mouth shut, or Iâ\\x80\\x99ll shut it for you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x98Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to see you try!â\\x80\\x99 says he. Then I gave him one across the face, and laid him out good and proper. After a bit I started to help him get up, but all he did was to kick at me from where he lay. So I gave him one with my knee and a couple more swipes. He was bleeding like a pig when Iâ\\x80\\x99d done with him. I asked him if heâ\\x80\\x99d had enough, and he said, â\\x80\\x98Yes.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d SintÃ ̈s was busy fixing his bandage while he talked, and I was sitting on the bed. â\\x80\\x9cSo you see,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cit wasnâ\\x80\\x99t my fault; he was asking for it, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he?â\\x80\\x9d I nodded, and he added: â\\x80\\x9cAs a matter of fact, I rather want to ask your advice about something; itâ\\x80\\x99s connected with this business. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve knocked about the world a bit, and I daresay you can help me. And then Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be your pal for life; I never forget anyone who does me a good turn.â\\x80\\x9d When I made no comment, he asked me if Iâ\\x80\\x99d like us to be pals. I replied that I had no objection, and that appeared to satisfy him. He got out the black pudding, cooked it in a frying pan, then laid the table, putting out two bottles of wine. While he was doing this he didnâ\\x80\\x99t speak. We started dinner, and then he began telling me the whole story, hesitating a bit at first. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a girl behind itâ\\x80\\x94as usual. We slept together pretty regular. I was keeping her, as a matter of fact, and she cost me a tidy sum. That fellow I knocked down is her brother.â\\x80\\x9d Noticing that I said nothing, he added that he knew what the neighbors said about him, but it was a filthy lie. He had his principles like everybody else, and a job in a warehouse. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cto go on with my story... I found out one day that she was letting me down.â\\x80\\x9d He gave her enough money to keep her going, without extravagance, though; he paid the rent of her room and twenty francs a day for food. â\\x80\\x9cThree hundred francs for rent, and six hundred for her grub, with a little present thrown in now and then, a pair of stockings or whatnot. Say, a thousand francs a month. But that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t enough for my fine lady; she was always grumbling that she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make both ends meet with what I gave her. So one day I says to her, â\\x80\\x98Look here, why not get a job for a few hours a day? Thatâ\\x80\\x99d make things easier for me, too. I bought you a new dress this month, I pay your rent and give you twenty francs a day. But you go and waste your money at the cafÃ© with a pack of girls. You give them coffee and sugar. And, of course, the money comes out of my pocket. I treat you on the square, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s how you pay me back.â\\x80\\x99 But she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t hear of working, though she kept on saying she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t make do with what I gave her. And then one day I found out she was doing me dirt.â\\x80\\x9d He went on to explain that heâ\\x80\\x99d found a lottery ticket in her bag, and, when he asked where the moneyâ\\x80\\x99d come from to buy it, she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t tell him. Then, another time, heâ\\x80\\x99d found a pawn ticket for two bracelets that heâ\\x80\\x99d never set eyes on. â\\x80\\x9cSo I knew there was dirty work going on, and I told her Iâ\\x80\\x99d have nothing more to do with her. But, first, I gave her a good hiding, and I told her some home truths. I said that there was only one thing interested her and that was getting into bed with men whenever sheâ\\x80\\x99d the chance. And I warned her straight, â\\x80\\x98Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be sorry one day, my girl, and wish youâ\\x80\\x99d got me back. All the girls in the street, theyâ\\x80\\x99re jealous of your luck in having me to keep you.â\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x9d Heâ\\x80\\x99d beaten her till the blood came. Before that heâ\\x80\\x99d never beaten her. â\\x80\\x9cWell, not hard, anyhow; only affectionately-like. Sheâ\\x80\\x99d howl a bit, and I had to shut the window. Then, of course, it ended as per usual. But this time Iâ\\x80\\x99m done with her. Only, to my mind, I ainâ\\x80\\x99t punished her enough. See what I mean?â\\x80\\x9d He explained that it was about this he wanted my advice. The lamp was smoking, and he stopped pacing up and down the room, to lower the wick. I just listened, without speaking. Iâ\\x80\\x99d had a whole bottle of wine to myself and my head was buzzing. As Iâ\\x80\\x99d used up my cigarettes I was smoking Raymondâ\\x80\\x99s. Some late streetcars passed, and the last noises of the street died off with them. Raymond went on talking. What bored him was that he had â\\x80\\x9ca sort of lech on herâ\\x80\\x9d as he called it. But he was quite determined to teach her a lesson. His first idea, he said, had been to take her to a hotel, and then call in the special police. Heâ\\x80\\x99d persuade them to put her on the register as a â\\x80\\x9ccommon prostitute,â\\x80\\x9d and that would make her wild. Then heâ\\x80\\x99d looked up some friends of his in the underworld, fellows who kept tarts for what they could make out of them, but they had practically nothing to suggest. Still, as he pointed out, that sort of thing should have been right up their street; whatâ\\x80\\x99s the good of being in that line if you donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to treat a girl whoâ\\x80\\x99s let you down? When he told them that, they suggested he should â\\x80\\x9cbrandâ\\x80\\x9d her. But that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t what he wanted, either. It would need a lot of thinking out.... But, first, heâ\\x80\\x99d like to ask me something. Before he asked it, though, heâ\\x80\\x99d like to have my opinion of the story heâ\\x80\\x99d been telling, in a general way. I said I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t any, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d found it interesting. Did I think she really had done him dirt? I had to admit it looked like that. Then he asked me if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think she should be punished and what Iâ\\x80\\x99d do if I were in his shoes. I told him one could never be quite sure how to act in such cases, but I quite understood his wanting her to suffer for it. I drank some more wine, while Raymond lit another cigarette and began explaining what he proposed to do. He wanted to write her a letter, â\\x80\\x9ca real stinker, thatâ\\x80\\x99ll get her on the raw,â\\x80\\x9d and at the same time make her repent of what sheâ\\x80\\x99d done. Then, when she came back, heâ\\x80\\x99d go to bed with her and, just when she was â\\x80\\x9cproperly primed up,â\\x80\\x9d heâ\\x80\\x99d spit in her face and throw her out of the room. I agreed it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a bad plan; it would punish her, all right. But, Raymond told me, he didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel up to writing the kind of letter that was needed, and that was where I could help. When I didnâ\\x80\\x99t say anything, he asked me if Iâ\\x80\\x99d mind doing it right away, and I said, â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d Iâ\\x80\\x99d have a shot at it. He drank off a glass of wine and stood up. Then he pushed aside the plates and the bit of cold pudding that was left, to make room on the table. After carefully wiping the oilcloth, he got a sheet of squared paper from the drawer of his bedside table; after that, an envelope, a small red wooden penholder, and a square inkpot with purple ink in it. The moment he mentioned the girlâ\\x80\\x99s name I knew she was a Moor. I wrote the letter. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t take much trouble over it, but I wanted to satisfy Raymond, as Iâ\\x80\\x99d no reason not to satisfy him. Then I read out what Iâ\\x80\\x99d written. Puffing at his cigarette, he listened, nodding now and then. â\\x80\\x9cRead it again, please,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He seemed delighted. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s the stuff,â\\x80\\x9d he chuckled. â\\x80\\x9cI could tell you was a brainy sort, old boy, and you know whatâ\\x80\\x99s what.â\\x80\\x9d At first I hardly noticed that â\\x80\\x9cold boy.â\\x80\\x9d It came back to me when he slapped me on the shoulder and said, â\\x80\\x9cSo now weâ\\x80\\x99re pals, ainâ\\x80\\x99t we?â\\x80\\x9d I kept silence and he said it again. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t care one way or the other, but as he seemed so set on it, I nodded and said, â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d He put the letter into the envelope and we finished off the wine. Then both of us smoked for some minutes, without speaking. The street was quite quiet, except when now and again a car passed. Finally, I remarked that it was getting late, and Raymond agreed. â\\x80\\x9cTimeâ\\x80\\x99s gone mighty fast this evening,â\\x80\\x9d he added, and in a way that was true. I wanted to be in bed, only it was such an effort making a move. I must have looked tired, for Raymond said to me, â\\x80\\x9cYou mustnâ\\x80\\x99t let things get you down.â\\x80\\x9d At first I didnâ\\x80\\x99t catch his meaning. Then he explained that he had heard of my motherâ\\x80\\x99s death; anyhow, he said, that was something bound to happen one day or another. I appreciated that, and told him so. When I rose, Raymond shook hands very warmly, remarking that men always understood each other. After closing the door behind me I lingered for some moments on the landing. The whole building was as quiet as the grave, a dank, dark smell rising from the well hole of the stairs. I could hear nothing but the blood throbbing in my ears, and for a while I stood still, listening to it. Then the dog began to moan in old Salamanoâ\\x80\\x99s room, and through the sleep-bound house the little plaintive sound rose slowly, like a flower growing out of the silence and the darkness. IV I HAD a busy time in the office throughout the week. Raymond dropped in once to tell me heâ\\x80\\x99d sent off the letter. I went to the pictures twice with Emmanuel, who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t always understand whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening on the screen and asks me to explain it. Yesterday was Saturday, and Marie came as weâ\\x80\\x99d arranged. She had a very pretty dress, with red and white stripes, and leather sandals, and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t take my eyes off her. One could see the outline of her firm little breasts, and her sun-tanned face was like a velvety brown flower. We took the bus and went to a beach I know, some miles out of Algiers. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a strip of sand between two rocky spurs, with a line of rushes at the back, along the tide line. At four oâ\\x80\\x99clock the sun wasnâ\\x80\\x99t too hot, but the water was pleasantly tepid, and small, languid ripples were creeping up the sand. Marie taught me a new game. The idea was, while one swam, to suck in the spray off the waves and, when oneâ\\x80\\x99s mouth was full of foam, to lie on oneâ\\x80\\x99s back and spout it out against the sky. It made a sort of frothy haze that melted into the air or fell back in a warm shower on oneâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks. But very soon my mouth was smarting with all the salt Iâ\\x80\\x99d drawn in; then Marie came up and hugged me in the water, and pressed her mouth to mine. Her tongue cooled my lips, and we let the waves roll us about for a minute or two before swimming back to the beach. When we had finished dressing, Marie looked hard at me. Her eyes were sparkling. I kissed her; after that neither of us spoke for quite a while. I pressed her to my side as we scrambled up the foreshore. Both of us were in a hurry to catch the bus, get back to my place, and tumble on to the bed. Iâ\\x80\\x99d left my window open, and it was pleasant to feel the cool night air flowing over our sunburned bodies. Marie said she was free next morning, so I proposed she should have luncheon with me. She agreed, and I went down to buy some meat. On my way back I heard a womanâ\\x80\\x99s voice in Raymondâ\\x80\\x99s room.

A little later old Salamano started grumbling at his dog and presently there was a sound of boots and paws on the wooden stairs; then, â\\x80\\x9cFilthy brute! Get on, you cur!â\\x80\\x9d and the two of them went out into the street. I told Marie about the old manâ\\x80\\x99s habits, and it made her laugh. She was wearing one of my pajama suits, and had the sleeves rolled up. When she laughed I wanted her again. A moment later she asked me if I loved her. I said that sort of question had no meaning, really; but I supposed I didnâ\\x80\\x99t. She looked sad for a bit, but when we were getting our lunch ready she brightened up and started laughing, and when she laughs I always want to kiss her. It was just then that the row started in Raymondâ\\x80\\x99s room. First we heard a woman saying something in a high-pitched voice; then Raymond bawling at her, â\\x80\\x9cYou let me down, you bitch! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll learn you to let me down!â\\x80\\x9d There came some thuds, then a piercing screamâ\\x80\\x94it made oneâ\\x80\\x99s blood run coldâ\\x80\\x94and in a moment there was a crowd of people on the landing. Marie and I went out to see. The woman was still screaming and Raymond still knocking her about. Marie said, wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it horrible! I didnâ\\x80\\x99t answer anything. Then she asked me to go and fetch a policeman, but I told her I didnâ\\x80\\x99t like policemen. However, one turned up presently; the lodger on the second floor, a plumber, came up, with him. When he banged on the door the noise stopped inside the room. He knocked again, and, after a moment, the woman started crying, and Raymond opened the door. He had a cigarette dangling from his underlip and a rather sickly smile. â\\x80\\x9cYour name?â\\x80\\x9d Raymond gave his name. â\\x80\\x9cTake that cigarette out of your mouth when youâ\\x80\\x99re talking to me,â\\x80\\x9d the policeman said gruffly. Raymond hesitated, glanced at me, and kept the cigarette in his mouth. The policeman promptly swung his arm and gave him a good hard smack on the left cheek. The cigarette shot from his lips and dropped a yard away. Raymond made a wry face, but said nothing for a moment. Then in a humble tone he asked if he mightnâ\\x80\\x99t pick up his cigarette. The officer said, â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d and added: â\\x80\\x9cBut donâ\\x80\\x99t you forget next time that we donâ\\x80\\x99t stand for any nonsense, not from guys like you.â\\x80\\x9d Meanwhile the girl went on sobbing and repeating: â\\x80\\x9cHe hit me, the coward. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a pimp.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me, officer,â\\x80\\x9d Raymond put in, â\\x80\\x9cbut is that in order, calling a man a pimp in the presence of witnesses?â\\x80\\x9d The policeman told him to shut his trap. Raymond then turned to the girl. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you worry, my pet. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll meet again.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s enough,â\\x80\\x9d the policeman said, and told the girl to go away. Raymond was to stay in his room till summoned to the police station. â\\x80\\x9cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,â\\x80\\x9d the policeman added, â\\x80\\x9cgetting so tight you canâ\\x80\\x99t stand steady. Why, youâ\\x80\\x99re shaking all over!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not tight,â\\x80\\x9d Raymond explained. â\\x80\\x9cOnly when I see you standing there and looking at me, I canâ\\x80\\x99t help trembling. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s only natural.â\\x80\\x9d Then he closed his door, and we all went away. Marie and I finished getting our lunch ready. But she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t any appetite, and I ate nearly all. She left at one, and then I had a nap. Toward three there was a knock at my door and Raymond came in. He sat down on the edge of my bed and for a minute or two said nothing. I asked him how it had gone off. He said it had all gone quite smoothly at first, as per program; only then sheâ\\x80\\x99d slapped his face and heâ\\x80\\x99d seen red, and started thrashing her. As for what happened after that, he neednâ\\x80\\x99t tell me, as I was there. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d I said, â\\x80\\x9cyou taught her a lesson, all right, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s what you wanted, isnâ\\x80\\x99t it?â\\x80\\x9d He agreed, and pointed out that whatever the police did, that wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t change the fact sheâ\\x80\\x99d had her punishment. As for the police, he knew exactly how to handle them. But heâ\\x80\\x99d like to know if Iâ\\x80\\x99d expected him to return the blow when the policeman hit him. I told him I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t expected anything whatsoever and, anyhow, I had no use for the police. Raymond seemed pleased and asked if Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to come out for a stroll with him. I got up from the bed and started brushing my hair. Then Raymond said that what he really wanted was for me to act as his witness. I told him I had no objection; only I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know what he expected me to say. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite simple,â\\x80\\x9d he replied. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve only got to tell them that the girl had let me down.â\\x80\\x9d So I agreed to be his witness. We went out together, and Raymond stood me a brandy in a cafÃ©. Then we had a game of billiards; it was a close game and I lost by only a few points. After that he proposed going to a brothel, but I refused; I didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel like it. As we were walking slowly back he told me how pleased he was at having paid out his mistress so satisfactorily. He made himself extremely amiable to me, and I quite enjoyed our walk. When we were nearly home I saw old Salamano on the doorstep; he seemed very excited. I noticed that his dog wasnâ\\x80\\x99t with him. He was turning like a teetotum, looking in all directions, and sometimes peering into the darkness of the hall with his little bloodshot eyes. Then heâ\\x80\\x99d mutter something to himself and start gazing up and down the street again. Raymond asked him what was wrong, but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t answer at once. Then I heard him grunt, â\\x80\\x9cThe bastard! The filthy cur!â\\x80\\x9d When I asked him where his dog was, he scowled at me and snapped out, â\\x80\\x9cGone!â\\x80\\x9d A moment later, all of a sudden, he launched out into it. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d taken him to the Parade Ground as usual. There was a fair on, and you could hardly move for the crowd. I stopped at one of the booths to look at the Handcuff King. When I turned to go, the dog was gone. Iâ\\x80\\x99d been meaning to get a smaller collar, but I never thought the brute could slip it and get away like that.â\\x80\\x9d Raymond assured him the dog would find its way home, and told him stories of dogs that had traveled miles and miles to get back to their masters. But this seemed to make the old fellow even more worried than before. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you understand, theyâ\\x80\\x99ll do away with him; the police, I mean. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not likely anyone will take him in and look after him; with all those scabs he puts everybody off.â\\x80\\x9d I told him that there was a pound at the police station, where stray dogs are taken. His dog was certain to be there and he could get it back on payment of a small charge. He asked me how much the charge was, but there I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help him. Then he flew into a rage again. â\\x80\\x9cIs it likely Iâ\\x80\\x99d give money for a mutt like that? No damned fear! They can kill him, for all I care.â\\x80\\x9d And he went on calling his dog the usual names. Raymond gave a laugh and turned into the hall. I followed him upstairs, and we parted on the landing. A minute or two later I heard Salamanoâ\\x80\\x99s footsteps and a knock on my door. When I opened it, he halted for a moment in the doorway. â\\x80\\x9cExcuse me... I hope Iâ\\x80\\x99m not disturbing you.â\\x80\\x9d I asked him in, but he shook his head. He was staring at his toe caps, and the gnarled old hands were trembling. Without meeting my eyes, he started talking. â\\x80\\x9cThey wonâ\\x80\\x99t really take him from me, will they, Monsieur Meursault? Surely they wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do a thing like that. If they doâ\\x80\\x94I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what will become of me.â\\x80\\x9d I told him that, so far as I knew, they kept stray dogs in the pound for three days, waiting for their owners to call for them. After that they disposed of the dogs as they thought fit. He stared at me in silence for a moment, then said, â\\x80\\x9cGood evening.â\\x80\\x9d After that I heard him pacing up and down his room for quite a while. Then his bed creaked. Through the wall there came to me a little wheezing sound, and I guessed that he was weeping. For some reason, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what, I began thinking of Mother.

He said that a friend of hisâ\\x80\\x94to whom heâ\\x80\\x99d spoken about meâ\\x80\\x94invited me to spend next Sunday at his little seaside bungalow just outside Algiers. I told him Iâ\\x80\\x99d have been delighted; only I had promised to spend Sunday with a girl. Raymond promptly replied that she could come, too. In fact, his friendâ\\x80\\x99s wife would be very pleased not to be the only woman in a party of men. Iâ\\x80\\x99d have liked to hang up at once, as my employer doesnâ\\x80\\x99t approve of my using the office phone for private calls. But Raymond asked me to hold on; he had something else to tell me, and that was why heâ\\x80\\x99d rung me up, though he could have waited till the evening to pass on the invitation. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s like this,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been shadowed all the morning by some Arabs. One of themâ\\x80\\x99s the brother of that girl I had the row with. If you see him hanging round the house when you come back, pass me the word.â\\x80\\x9d I promised to do so. Just then my employer sent for me. For a moment I felt uneasy, as I expected he was going to tell me to stick to my work and not waste time chattering with friends over the phone. However, it was nothing of the kind. He wanted to discuss a project he had in view, though so far heâ\\x80\\x99d come to no decision. It was to open a branch at Paris, so as to be able to deal with the big companies on the spot, without postal delays, and he wanted to know if Iâ\\x80\\x99d like a post there. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re a young man,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty sure youâ\\x80\\x99d enjoy living in Paris. And, of course, you could travel about France for some months in the year.â\\x80\\x9d I told him I was quite prepared to go; but really I didnâ\\x80\\x99t care much one way or the other. He then asked if a â\\x80\\x9cchange of life,â\\x80\\x9d as he called it, didnâ\\x80\\x99t appeal to me, and I answered that one never changed his way of life; one life was as good as another, and my present one suited me quite well. At this he looked rather hurt, and told me that I always shilly-shallied, and that I lacked ambitionâ\\x80\\x94a grave defect, to his mind, when one was in business. I returned to my work. Iâ\\x80\\x99d have preferred not to vex him, but I saw no reason for â\\x80\\x9cchanging my life.â\\x80\\x9d By and large it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t an unpleasant one. As a student Iâ\\x80\\x99d had plenty of ambition of the kind he meant. But, when I had to drop my studies, I very soon realized all that was pretty futile. Marie came that evening and asked me if Iâ\\x80\\x99d marry her. I said I didnâ\\x80\\x99t mind; if she was keen on it, weâ\\x80\\x99d get married. Then she asked me again if I loved her. I replied, much as before, that her question meant nothing or next to nothingâ\\x80\\x94but I supposed I didnâ\\x80\\x99t. â\\x80\\x9cIf thatâ\\x80\\x99s how you feel,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cwhy marry me?â\\x80\\x9d I explained that it had no importance really, but, if it would give her pleasure, we could get married right away. I pointed out that, anyhow, the suggestion came from her; as for me, Iâ\\x80\\x99d merely said, â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d Then she remarked that marriage was a serious matter. To which I answered: â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d She kept silent after that, staring at me in a curious way. Then she asked: â\\x80\\x9cSuppose another girl had asked you to marry herâ\\x80\\x94I mean, a girl you liked in the same way as you like meâ\\x80\\x94would you have said â\\x80\\x98Yesâ\\x80\\x99 to her, too?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNaturally.â\\x80\\x9d Then she said she wondered if she really loved me or not. I, of course, couldnâ\\x80\\x99t enlighten her as to that. And, after another silence, she murmured something about my being â\\x80\\x9ca queer fellow.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd I daresay thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I love you,â\\x80\\x9d she added. â\\x80\\x9cBut maybe thatâ\\x80\\x99s why one day Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come to hate you.â\\x80\\x9d To which I had nothing to say, so I said nothing. She thought for a bit, then started smiling and, taking my arm, repeated that she was in earnest; she really wanted to marry me. â\\x80\\x9cAll right,â\\x80\\x9d I answered. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll get married whenever you like.â\\x80\\x9d I then mentioned the proposal made by my employer, and Marie said sheâ\\x80\\x99d love to go to Paris. When I told her Iâ\\x80\\x99d lived in Paris for a while, she asked me what it was like. â\\x80\\x9cA dingy sort of town, to my mind. Masses of pigeons and dark courtyards. And the people have washed-out, white faces.â\\x80\\x9d Then we went for a walk all the way across the town by the main streets. The women were good-lookers, and I asked Marie if she, too, noticed this. She said, â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d and that she saw what I meant. After that we said nothing for some minutes. However, as I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want her to leave me, I suggested we should dine together at CÃ©lesteâ\\x80\\x99s. Sheâ\\x80\\x99d have loved to dine with me, she said, only she was booked up for the evening. We were near my place, and I said, â\\x80\\x9cAu revoir, then.â\\x80\\x9d She looked me in the eyes. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you want to know what Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing this evening?â\\x80\\x9d I did want to know, but I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t thought of asking her, and I guessed she was making a grievance of it. I must have looked embarrassed, for suddenly she started laughing and bent toward me, pouting her lips for a kiss. I went by myself to CÃ©lesteâ\\x80\\x99s. When I had just started my dinner an odd- looking little woman came in and asked if she might sit at my table. Of course she might. She had a chubby face like a ripe apple, bright eyes, and moved in a curiously jerky way, as if she were on wires. After taking off her closefitting jacket she sat down and started studying the bill of fare with a sort of rapt attention. Then she called CÃ©leste and gave her order, very fast but quite distinctly; one didnâ\\x80\\x99t lose a word. While waiting for the hors dâ\\x80\\x99oeuvre she opened her bag, took out a slip of paper and a pencil, and added up the bill in advance. Diving into her bag again, she produced a purse and took from it the exact sum, plus a small tip, and placed it on the cloth in front of her. Just then the waiter brought the hors dâ\\x80\\x99oeuvre, which she proceeded to wolf down voraciously. While waiting for the next course, she produced another pencil, this time a blue one, from her bag, and the radio magazine for the coming week, and started making ticks against almost all the items of the daily programs. There were a dozen pages in the magazine, and she continued studying them closely throughout the meal. When Iâ\\x80\\x99d finished mine she was still ticking off items with the same meticulous attention. Then she rose, put on her jacket again with the same abrupt, robot-like gestures, and walked briskly out of the restaurant. Having nothing better to do, I followed her for a short distance. Keeping on the curb of the pavement, she walked straight ahead, never swerving or looking back, and it was extraordinary how fast she covered the ground, considering her smallness. In fact, the pace was too much for me, and I soon lost sight of her and turned back homeward. For a moment the â\\x80\\x9clittle robotâ\\x80\\x9d (as I thought of her) had much impressed me, but I soon forgot about her. As I was turning in at my door I ran into old Salamano. I asked him into my room, and he informed me that his dog was definitely lost. Heâ\\x80\\x99d been to the pound to inquire, but it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there, and the staff told him it had probably been run over. When he asked them whether it was any use inquiring about it at the police station, they said the police had more important things to attend to than keeping records of stray dogs run over in the streets. I suggested he should get another dog, but, reasonably enough, he pointed out that heâ\\x80\\x99d become used to this one, and it wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be the same thing. I was seated on my bed, with my legs up, and Salamano on a chair beside the table, facing me, his hands spread on his knees. He had kept on his battered felt hat and was mumbling away behind his draggled yellowish mustache. I found him rather boring, but I had nothing to do and didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel sleepy. So, to keep the conversation going, I asked some questions about his dogâ\\x80\\x94how long he had had it and so forth. He told me he had got it soon after his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s death. Heâ\\x80\\x99d married rather late in life. When a young man, he wanted to go on the stage; during his military service heâ\\x80\\x99d often played in the regimental theatricals and acted rather well, so everybody said. However, finally, he had taken a job in the railway, and he didnâ\\x80\\x99t regret it, as now he had a small pension. He and his wife had never hit it off very well, but theyâ\\x80\\x99d got used to each other, and when she died he felt lonely. One of his mates on the railway whose bitch had just had pups had offered him one, and he had taken it, as a companion. Heâ\\x80\\x99d had to feed it from the bottle at first. But, as a dogâ\\x80\\x99s life is shorter than a manâ\\x80\\x99s, theyâ\\x80\\x99d grown old together, so to speak. â\\x80\\x9cHe was a cantankerous brute,â\\x80\\x9d Salamano said. â\\x80\\x9cNow and then we had some proper set-tos, he and I. But he was a good mutt all the same.â\\x80\\x9d I said he looked well bred, and that evidently pleased the old man. â\\x80\\x9cAh, but you should have seen him before his illness!â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cHe had a wonderful coat; in fact, that was his best point, really. I tried hard to cure him; every mortal night after he got that skin disease I rubbed an ointment in. But his real trouble was old age, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no curing that.â\\x80\\x9d Just then I yawned, and the old man said heâ\\x80\\x99d better make a move. I told him he could stay, and that I was sorry about what had happened to his dog. He thanked me, and mentioned that my mother had been very fond of his dog. He referred to her as â\\x80\\x9cyour poor mother,â\\x80\\x9d and was afraid I must be feeling her death terribly. When I said nothing he added hastily and with a rather embarrassed air that some of the people in the street said nasty things about me because Iâ\\x80\\x99d sent my mother to the Home. But he, of course, knew better; he knew how devoted to my mother I had always been. I answeredâ\\x80\\x94why, I still donâ\\x80\\x99t knowâ\\x80\\x94that it surprised me to learn Iâ\\x80\\x99d produced such a bad impression. As I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t afford to keep her here, it seemed the obvious thing to do, to send her to a home. â\\x80\\x9cIn any case,â\\x80\\x9d I added, â\\x80\\x9cfor years sheâ\\x80\\x99d never had a word to say to me, and I could see she was moping, with no one to talk to.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand at a home one makes friends, anyhow.â\\x80\\x9d He got up, saying it was high time for him to be in bed, and added that life was going to be a bit of a problem for him, under the new conditions. For the first time since Iâ\\x80\\x99d known him he held out his hand to meâ\\x80\\x94rather shyly, I thoughtâ\\x80\\x94and I could feel the scales on his skin. Just as he was going out of the door, he turned and, smiling a little, said: â\\x80\\x9cLetâ\\x80\\x99s hope the dogs wonâ\\x80\\x99t bark again tonight. I always think itâ\\x80\\x99s mine I hear....â\\x80\\x9d VI IT was an effort waking up that Sunday morning; Marie had to jog my shoulders and shout my name. As we wanted to get into the water early, we didnâ\\x80\\x99t trouble about breakfast. My head was aching slightly and my first cigarette had a bitter taste. Marie told me I looked like a mourner at a funeral, and I certainly did feel very limp. She was wearing a white dress and had her hair loose. I told her she looked quite ravishing like that, and she laughed happily. On our way out we banged on Raymondâ\\x80\\x99s door, and he shouted that heâ\\x80\\x99d be with us in a jiffy. We went down to the street and, because of my being rather under the weather and our having kept the blind down in my room, the glare of the morning sun hit me in the eyes like a clenched fist. Marie, however, was almost dancing with delight, and kept repeating, â\\x80\\x9cWhat a heavenly day!â\\x80\\x9d After a few minutes I was feeling better, and noticed that I was hungry. I mentioned this to Marie, but she paid no attention. She was carrying an oilcloth bag in which she had stowed our bathing kit and a towel. Presently we heard Raymond shutting his door. He was wearing blue trousers, a short-sleeved white shirt, and a straw hat. I noticed that his forearms were rather hairy, but the skin was very white beneath. The straw hat made Marie giggle. Personally, I was rather put off by his getup. He seemed in high spirits and was whistling as he came down the stairs. He greeted me with, â\\x80\\x9cHello, old boy!â\\x80\\x9d and addressed Marie as â\\x80\\x9cMademoiselle.â\\x80\\x9d On the previous evening we had visited the police station, where I gave evidence for Raymondâ\\x80\\x94about the girlâ\\x80\\x99s having been false to him. So they let him off with a warning. They didnâ\\x80\\x99t check my statement. After some talk on the doorstep we decided to take the bus. The beach was within easy walking distance, but the sooner we got there the better.
