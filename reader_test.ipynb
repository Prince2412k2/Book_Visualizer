       "wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\n",
       "Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\n",
       "very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\n",
       "yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\n",

       "would, all things considered, be divided between</i> Emma <i>and the present\n",
       "book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\n",

       "of vulgarity) would go for</i> Emma. <i>It is the larger, the more varied, the\n",

       "more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\n",
       "peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\n",
       "Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\n",
       "I, for my part, declare for</i> Pride and Prejudice <i>unhesitatingly. It\n",
       "seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\n",
       "eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\n",
       "in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\n",
       "cause.</i></p>\n",
       "<p><i>In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\n",
       "reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\n",
       "when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\n",
       "finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\n",
       "1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in<span class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"pgepubid00006\" title=\"{xi}\"><a id=\"page_xi\" title=\"{xi}\"/></span> this\n",
       "combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\n",
       "critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\n",
       "superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\n",
       "possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\n",
       "regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\n",
       "could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\n",
       "and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a</i> coup de\n",
       "théâtre; <i>it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\n",
       "story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\n",
       "All the minor passages—the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\n",
       "Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour—fit in after the\n",
       "same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\n",
       "hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\n",
       "Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\n",
       "intrigue of</i> Emma, <i>but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\n",
       "the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\n",
       "always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\n",
       "opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\n",
       "be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\n",
       "natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\n",
       "by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\n",
       "the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\n",
       "aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\n",
       "the playwright has ever been laid upon</i> Pride and Prejudice; <i>and I dare\n",
       "say that,<span class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"pgepubid00007\" title=\"{xii}\"><a id=\"page_xii\" title=\"{xii}\"/></span> if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\n",
       "garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\n",
       "delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\n",
       "certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\n",
       "which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\n",
       "avail himself, appear at once on the stage.</i></p>\n",
       "<p><i>I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\n",
       "more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\n",
       "merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\n",
       "and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\n",
       "will sometimes mar those graces—appreciably, though not quite\n",
       "consciously—to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\n",
       "novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\n",
       "displayed consummate command of dialogue—perhaps the rarest of all\n",
       "faculties—would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\n",
       "acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\n",
       "ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\n",
       "should put</i> Pride and Prejudice <i>far lower if it did not contain what\n",
       "seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\n",
       "faculty of character-creation—masterpieces who may indeed admit John\n",
       "Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\n",
       "but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\n",
       "superior to them.</i></p>\n",
       "<p><i>The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\n",
       "that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\n",
       "express, and at any particular<span class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"pgepubid00008\" title=\"{xiii}\"><a id=\"page_xiii\" title=\"{xiii}\"/></span> time likely to be differently\n",
       "apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\n",
       "greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\n",
       "the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\n",
       "scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\n",
       "obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\n",
       "for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\n",
       "Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\n",
       "masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\n",
       "common subdivisions of quality—demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\n",
       "avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\n",
       "certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\n",
       "who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\n",
       "savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\n",
       "of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\n",
       "her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\n",
       "protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\n",
       "restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\n",
       "roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\n",
       "of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\n",
       "nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\n",
       "would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\n",
       "husband in the</i> Spectator, <i>who describes, with all the gusto and all the\n",
       "innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\n",

       "of fourteen who<span class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"pgepubid00009\" title=\"{xiv}\"><a id=\"page_xiv\" title=\"{xiv}\"/></span> wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\n",
       "Mentor that “he admires your</i> Spectators <i>mightily”—might have been\n",
       "written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\n",
       "days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\n",
       "think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\n",
       "own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\n",
       "her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\n",
       "English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\n",
       "falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\n",
       "snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\n",
       "the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\n",
       "beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\n",
       "that to seem is not identical with to be—if this be cynicism, then\n",
       "every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\n",
       "fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\n",
       "a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\n",
       "have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\n",
       "took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\n",
       "work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\n",
       "and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\n",
       "was immensely the better for it as an artist.</i></p>\n",
       "<p><i>In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\n",
       "that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\n",
       "combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\n",
       "we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature<span class=\"x-ebookmaker-pageno\" id=\"pgepubid00010\" title=\"{xv}\"><a id=\"page_xv\" title=\"{xv}\"/></span>\n",
       "painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\n",
       "term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\n",
       "at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\n",
       "of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\n",
       "myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\n",
       "microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\n",
       "littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\n",
       "paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\n",
       "feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\n",
       "short periods of writing—one of about three years, and another of not\n",
       "much more than five—she executed six capital works, and has not left a\n",
       "single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\n",
       "composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly anybody\n",
       "born in her decade—that of the eighteenth-century\n",
       "seventies—independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\n",
       "required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\n",
       "German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\n",

       "subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\n",
       "Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\n",
