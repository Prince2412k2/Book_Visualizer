       "'He leaned his head toward the drawing:\\n\"Not so small as that. He fell asleep… \"\\nAnd so I made the acquaintance of the little prince.\\nIII\\nIt took me a long time to understand where he came from. The little\\nprince, who asked me many questions, never seemed to hear mine.\\nThese are words spoken by chance that, little by little, have\\nrevealed all to me. So when he saw my plane for the first time (I\\nwill not draw my plane, it is a drawing too complicated for me) he\\nasked me:\\n\"What is that thing?\"\\n- It\\'s not a thing. It flies. It\\'s a plane. This is my plane. \"\\nAnd I was proud to tell him I was flying. Then he exclaimed:\\n\"How! You have fallen from heaven!\\n- Yes, I said modestly.\\n\"Ah! Now that\\'s funny… \"\\nAnd the little prince had a very pretty burst of laughter, which\\nirritated me very much. I wish to take my misfortunes seriously.\\nThen he added:\\n\"Then you too come from heaven!\" What planet are you from?\\nI caught a glimpse in the mystery of his presence, and I suddenly\\nquestioned:\\n\"So you\\'re from another planet?\"\\nBut he did not answer me. He nodded softly as he looked at my\\nplane:\\n\"It\\'s true that you can not come very far from it.\"\\nAnd he sank into a reverie that lasted for a long time. Then, taking\\nmy sheep out of his pocket, he plunged into the contemplation of\\nhis treasure.\\nYou can imagine how intrigued I was by this half-confidence about\\n\"the other planets.\" I therefore endeavored to learn more:\\n\"Where do you come from, my little fellow?\" Where is \"at home\"?\\nWhere do you want to take my sheep?\\nHe replied after a meditative silence:\\n\"What is good, with the box you gave me, is that, at night, it will\\nserve him as a house.\"\\n- Of course. And if you are kind, I will also give you a rope to tie it\\nup during the day. And a picket. \"\\nThe proposal seemed to shock the little prince:\\n\"Attach it?\" What a funny idea !\\n\"But if you do not tie him, he\\'ll go anywhere, and he\\'ll get lost.\"\\nAnd my friend burst into laughter again:\\n- But where do you want him to go !\\n- Anywhere. Right in front of him…\\nThen the little prince gravely remarked,\\n- It does not matter, it\\'s so small, at home!\\nAnd, with a little melancholy, perhaps, he added:\\n- Straight ahead you can not go far ...\\nIV\\nI had learned a second very important thing: that its original planet\\nwas scarcely larger than a house!\\nIt could not surprise me much. I knew that besides the big planets\\nlike the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, which have been given names,\\nthere are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that it is\\nvery hard for them To see the telescope. When an astronomer\\ndiscovers one of them, he names it as a number. He calls it, for\\nexample, \"the asteroid 325\".\\n'"

The author, a grown-up who was once a dreamer and artist, but was discouraged from pursuing his passion, encounters the Little Prince, a mysterious figure from another planet. The Little Prince asks questions and exhibits a half-confidence about 'the other planets', which intrigues the author. The author learns that the Little Prince's home planet is small, barely larger than a house. This encounter marks a significant turning point in the author's life, leading him to question and learn more about the Little Prince and his origins.\n",
