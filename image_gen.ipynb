If you\\'re looking for magic and adventure, read this book.\\nFour volumes in braillle.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER ONE: THE BOY WHO LIVED\\n\\u3000Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to\\nsay that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were\\nthe last people you\\'d expect to be involved in anything strange or\\nmysterious, because they just didn\\'t hold with such nonsense.\\n\\u3000Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which\\nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although\\nhe did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde\\nand had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very\\nuseful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences,\\nspying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley\\nand in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\n\\u3000The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a\\nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.\\nThey didn\\'t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the\\nPotters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\\'s sister, but they hadn\\'t met for\\nseveral years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\\'t have a sister,\\nbecause her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as\\nunDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think\\nwhat the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\\nDursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had\\nnever even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping\\nthe Potters away; they didn\\'t want Dudley mixing with a child like\\nthat.\\n\\u3000When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our\\nstory starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest\\nthat strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over\\nthe country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie\\nfor work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a\\nscreaming Dudley into his high chair.\\n\\u3000None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\n\\u3000At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at\\nthe walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He\\ngot into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\n\\u3000It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\\ndidn\\'t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\\nDrive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been\\nthinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked\\nand stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\\ncorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now\\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake\\nand put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought\\nof nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\n\\u3000But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by\\nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t\\nhelp noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed\\nin funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed\\nthis was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the\\nsteering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing\\nquite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley\\nwas enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why,\\nthat man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green\\ncloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was\\nprobably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for\\nsomething... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few\\nminutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his\\nmind back on drills.\\n\\u3000Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on\\nthe ninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to\\nconcentrate on drills that morning. He didn\\'t see the owls swoop ing\\npast in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they\\npointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.\\nMost of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley,\\nhowever, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone calls and\\nshouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime,\\nwhen he thought he\\'d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy\\nhimself a bun from the bakery.\\n\\u3000He\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group\\nof them next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He\\ndidn\\'t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were\\nwhispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It\\nwas on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag,\\nthat he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\n\\u3000\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\\n\\u3000Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought\\nbetter of it.\\n\\u3000He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at\\nhis secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost\\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put\\nthe receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he\\nwas being stupid. Potter wasn\\'t such an unusual name. He was sure\\nthere were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry.\\nCome to think of it, he wasn\\'t even sure his nephew was called Harry.\\nHe\\'d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold.\\nThere was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset\\nat any mention of her sister. He didn\\'t blame her -- if he\\'d had a sister\\nlike that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...\\n\\u3000He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\\nwhen he left the building at five o\\'clock, he was still so worried that\\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\\n\\u3000\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was\\nwearing a violet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost\\nknocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide\\nsmile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t\\nbe sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for\\nYou-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be\\ncelebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\\n\\u3000And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked\\noff.\\n\\u3000Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a\\ncomplete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle,\\nwhatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for\\nhome, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped\\nbefore, because he didn\\'t approve of imagination.\\n\\u3000As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he\\nsaw -- and it didn\\'t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he\\'d spotted\\nthat morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it\\nwas the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\\n\\u3000\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave\\nhim a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley\\nwondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the\\nhouse. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\\n\\u3000Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner\\nall about Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how\\nDudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act\\nnormally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living\\nroom in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\\n\\u3000\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the\\nnation\\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls\\nnormally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there\\nhave been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every\\ndirection since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls\\nhave suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster\\nallowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls\\ntonight, Jim?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s\\nnot only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far\\napart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me\\nthat instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour\\nof shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night\\nearly -- it\\'s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night\\ntonight.\"\\n\\u3000Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over\\nBritain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over\\nthe place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\\n\\u3000Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It\\nwas no good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat\\nnervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sister\\nlately, have you?\"\\n\\u3000As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After\\nall, they normally pretended she didn\\'t have a sister.\\n\\u3000\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\\n\\u3000\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\\nstars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\\n\\u3000\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\\n\\u3000\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\\nknow... her crowd.\"\\n\\u3000Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley\\nwondered whether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He\\ndecided he didn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their\\nson -- he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"\\n\\u3000\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\u3000\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\\nagree.\"\\n\\u3000He didn\\'t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to\\nbed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the\\nbedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was\\nstill there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting\\nfor something.\\n\\u3000Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with\\nthe Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of --\\nwell, he didn\\'t think he could bear it.\\n\\u3000The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting\\nthought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were\\ninvolved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.\\nDursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought\\nabout them and their kind.... He couldn\\'t see how he and Petunia\\ncould get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned\\nand turned over -- it couldn\\'t affect them....\\n\\u3000How very wrong he was.\\n\\u3000Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the\\ncat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was\\nsitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner\\nof Privet Drive. It didn\\'t so much as quiver when a car door slammed\\non the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it\\nwas nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\n\\u3000A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared\\nso suddenly and silently you\\'d have thought he\\'d just popped out of\\nthe ground. The cat\\'s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\n\\u3000Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was\\ntall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard,\\nwhich were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing\\nlong robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled,\\nbuckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind\\nhalf-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as\\nthough it had been broken at least twice. This man\\'s name was Albus\\nDumbledore.\\n\\u3000Albus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in\\na street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome.\\nHe was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he\\ndid seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up\\nsuddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end\\nof the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse\\nhim. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\\n\\u3000He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to\\nbe a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air,\\nand clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He\\nclicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times\\nhe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat\\nwatching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-\\neyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\\'t be able to see anything that was\\nhappening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer\\nback inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four,\\nwhere he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\'t look at it, but\\nafter a moment he spoke to it.\\n\\u3000\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\\n\\u3000He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was\\nsmiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square\\nglasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its\\neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair\\nwas drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\n\\u3000\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\\n\\u3000\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n\\u3000\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have\\npassed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\n\\u3000\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently.\\n\"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles\\nhave noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked\\nher head back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it.\\nFlocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid.\\nThey were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent --\\nI\\'ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\\n\\u3000\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had\\nprecious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\\n\\u3000\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no\\nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on\\nthe streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,\\nswapping rumors.\"\\n\\u3000She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\\nhoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went\\non. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems\\nto have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I\\nsuppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"\\n\\u3000\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be\\nthankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\\n\\u3000\"A what?\"\\n\\u3000\"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of\"\\n\\u3000\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she\\ndidn\\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if\\nYou-Know-Who has gone -\"\\n\\u3000\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call\\nhim by his name? All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven\\nyears I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper\\nname: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore,\\nwho was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets\\nso confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any\\nreason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\\n\\u3000\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\nexasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows\\nyou\\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was\\nfrightened of.\"\\n\\u3000\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I\\nwill never have.\"\\n\\u3000\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said,\\n\"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You\\nknow what everyone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About\\nwhat finally stopped him?\"\\n\\u3000It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was\\nmost anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a\\ncold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she\\nfixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was\\nplain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to\\nbelieve it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,\\nhowever, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\n\\u3000\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort\\nturned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor\\nis that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\\'re -- dead. \"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\n\\u3000\"Lily and James... I can\\'t believe it... I didn\\'t want to believe it... Oh,\\nAlbus...\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\\nknow...\" he said heavily.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not\\nall. They\\'re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\'s son, Harry. But -- he\\ncouldn\\'t. He couldn\\'t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,\\nbut they\\'re saying that when he couldn\\'t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\'s\\npower somehow broke -- and that\\'s why he\\'s gone.\\n\\u3000Dumbledore nodded glumly.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s done...\\nall the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy? It\\'s just\\nastounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of\\nheaven did Harry survive?\"\\n\\u3000\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at\\nher eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he\\ntook a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very\\nodd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets\\nwere moving around the edge. It must have made sense to\\nDumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said,\\n\"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the\\nway?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going\\nto tell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only\\nfamily he has left now.\"\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried\\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number\\nfour. \"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You\\ncouldn\\'t find two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son\\n-- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming\\nfor sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'ve\\nwritten them a letter.\"\\n\\u3000\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down\\non the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in\\na letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous -- a\\nlegend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter\\nday in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every\\nchild in our world will know his name!\"\\n\\u3000\"Exactly,\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of\\nhis half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head.\\nFamous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t\\neven remember! CarA you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing\\nup away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,\\nswallowed, and then said, \"Yes -- yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how\\nis the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as\\nthough she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\"\\n\\u3000\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important\\nas this?\"\\n\\u3000I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He\\ndoes tend to -- what was that?\"\\n\\u3000A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of\\na headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky --\\nand a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in\\nfront of them.\\n\\u3000If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride\\nit. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times\\nas wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long\\ntangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had\\nhands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were\\nlike baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a\\nbundle of blankets.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where\\ndid you get that motorcycle?\"\\n\\u3000\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\" said the giant, climbing\\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to\\nme. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"\\n\\u3000\"No problems, were there?\"\\n\\u3000\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\\nbefore the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was\\nflyin\\' over Bristol.\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the\\nbundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep.\\nUnder a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a\\ncuriously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\\n\\u3000\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"\\n\\u3000\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\\n\\u3000\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one\\nmyself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London\\nUnderground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over\\nwith.\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\'\\nhouse.\\n\\u3000\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent\\nhis great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been\\na very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl\\nlike a wounded dog.\\n\\u3000\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"\\n\\u3000\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief\\nand burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James\\ndead -- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll\\nbe found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly\\non the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and\\nwalked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a\\nletter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came\\nback to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and\\nlooked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor\\nMcGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually\\nshone from Dumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\n\\u3000\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business\\nstaying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his\\nbike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore,\\nsir.\"\\n\\u3000Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung\\nhimself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a\\nroar it rose into the air and off into the night.\\n\\u3000\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said\\nDumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in\\nreply.\\n\\u3000Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner\\nhe stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and\\ntwelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet\\nDrive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat\\nslinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just\\nsee the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\n\\u3000\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a\\nswish of his cloak, he was gone.\\n\\u3000A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent\\nand tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\\nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter\\nbeside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing\\nhe was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time\\nby Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the\\nmilk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being\\nprodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at\\nthis very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were\\nholding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter\\n-- the boy who lived!\"\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TWO: THE VANISHING GLASS\\n\\u3000Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to\\nfind their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly\\nchanged at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up\\nthe brass number four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their\\nliving room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the\\nnight when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the\\nowls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how\\nmuch time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures\\nof what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored\\nbonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the\\nphotographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a\\ncarousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being\\nhugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that\\nanother boy lived in the house, too.\\n\\u3000Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that\\nmade the first noise of the day.\\n\\u3000\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\\n\\u3000Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\n\\u3000\"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen\\nand then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled\\nonto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It\\nhad been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had\\na funny feeling he\\'d had the same dream before.\\n\\u3000His aunt was back outside the door.\\n\\u3000\"Are you up yet?\" she demanded.\\n\\u3000\"Nearly,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t\\nyou dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\"\\n\\u3000Harry groaned.\\n\\u3000\"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door.\\n\\u3000\"Nothing, nothing...\"\\n\\u3000Dudley\\'s birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly\\nout of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed\\nand, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was\\nused to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of\\nthem, and that was where he slept.\\n\\u3000When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The\\ntable was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It\\nlooked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not\\nto mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why\\nDudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was\\nvery fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching\\nsomebody. Dudley\\'s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\'t\\noften catch him. Harry didn\\'t look it, but he was very fast.\\n\\u3000Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but\\nHarry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even\\nsmaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear\\nwere old clothes of Dudley\\'s, and Dudley was about four times bigger\\nthan he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and\\nbright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of\\nScotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the\\nnose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very\\nthin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he\\ncould ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten\\nit.\\n\\u3000\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t\\nask questions.\"\\n\\u3000Don\\'t ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nDursleys.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the\\nbacon.\\n\\u3000\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\n\\u3000About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his\\nnewspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have\\nhad more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put\\n\\u3000together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --\\nall over the place.\\n\\u3000Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen\\nwith his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a\\nlarge pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick\\nblond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often\\nsaid that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that\\nDudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\n\\u3000Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was\\ndifficult as there wasn\\'t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting\\nhis presents. His face fell.\\n\\u3000\"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two\\nless than last year.\"\\n\\u3000\"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here\\nunder this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\"\\n\\u3000\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face.\\nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began\\nwolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the\\ntable over.\\n\\u3000Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said\\nquickly, \"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out\\ntoday. How\\'s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\'\\'\\n\\u3000Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he\\nsaid slowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty ... thirty...\"\\n\\u3000\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\\n\\u3000\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All\\nright then.\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just\\nlike his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.\\n\\u3000At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to\\nanswer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the\\nracing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new\\ncomputer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold\\nwristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking\\nboth angry and worried.\\n\\u3000\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t\\ntake him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.\\n\\u3000Dudley\\'s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\'s heart gave a leap.\\nEvery year on Dudley\\'s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out\\nfor the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies.\\nEvery year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who\\nlived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled\\nof cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats\\nshe\\'d ever owned.\\n\\u3000\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as\\nthough he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs.\\nFigg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself\\nit would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr.\\nPaws, and Tufty again.\\n\\u3000\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\\n\\u3000The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\'t\\nthere -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\'t\\nunderstand them, like a slug.\\n\\u3000\"What about what\\'s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\"\\n\\u3000\"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia.\\n\\u3000\"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\'d be able\\nto watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even\\nhave a go on Dudley\\'s computer).\\n\\u3000Aunt Petunia looked as though she\\'d just swallowed a lemon.\\n\\u3000\"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled.\\n\\u3000\"I won\\'t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening.\\n\\u3000\"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly,\\n\"... and leave him in the car....\"\\n\\u3000\"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone....\"\\n\\u3000Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\'t really crying -- it had\\nbeen years since he\\'d really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up\\nhis face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\n\\u3000\"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your\\nspecial day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\n\\u3000\"I... don\\'t... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge,\\npretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty\\ngrin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms.\\n\\u3000Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said\\nAunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend,\\nPiers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with\\na face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms\\nbehind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending\\nto cry at once.\\n\\u3000Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\\'t believe his luck, was sitting\\nin the back of the Dursleys\\' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to\\nthe zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\\'t been\\nable to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\\'d left,\\nUncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right\\nup close to Harry\\'s, \"I\\'m warning you now, boy -- any funny business,\\nanything at all -- and you\\'ll be in that cupboard from now until\\nChristmas.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..\\n\\u3000But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did.\\n\\u3000The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and\\nit was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen.\\n\\u3000Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers\\nlooking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen\\nscissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his\\nbangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed\\nhimself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school\\nthe next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes\\nand taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find\\nhis hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off\\nHe had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he\\nhad tried to explain that he couldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so\\nquickly.\\n\\u3000Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a\\nrevolting old sweater of Dudley\\'s (brown with orange puff balls) -- The\\nharder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to\\nbecome, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly\\nwouldn\\'t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in\\nthe wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\\'t punished.\\n\\u3000On the other hand, he\\'d gotten into terrible trouble for being found\\non the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\\'s gang had been chasing\\nhim as usual when, as much to Harry\\'s surprise as anyone else\\'s, there\\nhe was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry\\nletter from Harry\\'s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing\\nschool buildings. But all he\\'d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle\\nVernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the\\nbig trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind\\nmust have caught him in mid- jump.\\n\\u3000But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being\\nwith Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\\'t\\nschool, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\\'s cabbage-smelling living room.\\n\\u3000While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked\\nto complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry,\\nthe bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This\\nmorning, it was motorcycles.\\n\\u3000\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a\\nmotorcycle overtook them.\\n\\u3000I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering\\nsuddenly. \"It was flying.\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right\\naround in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet\\nwith a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\"\\n\\u3000Dudley and Piers sniggered.\\n\\u3000I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\"\\n\\u3000But he wished he hadn\\'t said anything. If there was one thing the\\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking\\nabout anything acting in a way it shouldn\\'t, no matter if it was in a\\ndream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get\\ndangerous ideas.\\n\\u3000It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with\\nfamilies. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice\\ncreams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van\\nhad asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away,\\nthey bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\\'t bad, either, Harry\\nthought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who\\nlooked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\\'t blond.\\n\\u3000Harry had the best morning he\\'d had in a long time. He was careful\\nto walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers,\\nwho were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime,\\nwouldn\\'t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in\\nthe zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his\\nknickerbocker glory didn\\'t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle\\nVernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the\\nfirst.\\n\\u3000Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good\\nto last.\\n\\u3000After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in\\nthere, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts\\nof lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood\\nand stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and\\nthick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake\\nin the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle\\nVernon\\'s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it\\ndidn\\'t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\n\\u3000Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\nglistening brown coils.\\n\\u3000\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on\\nthe glass, but the snake didn\\'t budge.\\n\\u3000\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass\\nsmartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\n\\u3000\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\n\\u3000Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.\\nHe wouldn\\'t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no\\ncompany except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass\\ntrying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard\\nas a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on\\nthe door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.\\n\\u3000The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it\\nraised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\'s.\\n\\u3000It winked.\\n\\u3000Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\nwatching. They weren\\'t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\n\\u3000The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then\\nraised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite\\nplainly:\\n\\u3000\"I get that all the time.\\n\\u3000\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure\\nthe snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\"\\n\\u3000The snake nodded vigorously.\\n\\u3000\"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked.\\n\\u3000The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry\\npeered at it.\\n\\u3000Boa Constrictor, Brazil.\\n\\u3000\"Was it nice there?\"\\n\\u3000The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read\\non: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so you\\'ve never\\nbeen to Brazil?\"\\n\\u3000As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made\\nboth of them jump.\\n\\u3000\"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU\\nWON\\'T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\'S DOING!\"\\n\\u3000Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\n\\u3000\"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught\\nby surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next\\nhappened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and\\nDudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had\\nleapt back with howls of horror.\\n\\u3000Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\'s tank\\nhad vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering\\nout onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and\\nstarted running for the exits.\\n\\u3000As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,\\nhissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\"\\n\\u3000The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\n\\u3000\"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\"\\n\\u3000The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet\\ntea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could\\nonly gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything\\nexcept snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they\\nwere all back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it\\nhad nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to\\nsqueeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers\\ncalming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you,\\nHarry?\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He\\nmanaged to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he\\ncollapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a\\nlarge brandy.\\n\\u3000Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch.\\nHe didn\\'t know what time it was and he couldn\\'t be sure the Dursleys\\nwere asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\\'t risk sneaking to the\\nkitchen for some food.\\n\\u3000He\\'d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years,\\nas long as he could remember, ever since he\\'d been a baby and his\\nparents had died in that car crash. He couldn\\'t remember being in the\\ncar when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his\\nmemory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange\\nvision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his\\nforehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\\'t\\nimagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\\'t remember\\nhis parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of\\ncourse he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs\\nof them in the house.\\n\\u3000When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of\\nsome unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never\\nhappened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he\\nthought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know\\nhim. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top\\nhat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and\\nDudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia\\nhad rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-\\nlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him\\nonce on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually\\nshaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away\\nwithout a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the\\nway they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.\\n\\u3000At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\'s gang\\nhated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken\\nglasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\'s gang.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER THREE: THE LETTERS FROM NO\\nONE\\n\\u3000The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-\\never punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already\\nbroken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane,\\nand, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as\\nshe crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\n\\u3000Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\'s\\ngang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm,\\nand Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\\nhappy to join in Dudley\\'s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\n\\u3000This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the\\nhouse, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays,\\nwhere he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he\\nwould be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his\\nlife, he wouldn\\'t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle\\nVernon\\'s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there\\ntoo. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local\\npublic school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\\n\\u3000\"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at\\nStonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\\n\\u3000\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as\\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before\\nDudley could work out what he\\'d said.\\n\\u3000One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his\\nSmeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\\'s. Mrs. Figg wasn \\'t as\\nbad as usual. It turned out she\\'d broken her leg tripping over one of\\nher cats, and she didn\\'t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let\\nHarry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that\\ntasted as though she\\'d had it for several years.\\n\\u3000That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family\\nin his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\' boys wore maroon tailcoats,\\norange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also\\ncarried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers\\nweren\\'t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\\n\\u3000As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon\\nsaid gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia\\nburst into tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle\\nDudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\'t trust\\nhimself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have\\ncracked from trying not to laugh.\\n\\u3000There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when\\nHarry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large\\nmetal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of\\nwhat looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they\\nalways did if he dared to ask a question.\\n\\u3000\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\\n\\u3000Harry looked in the bowl again.\\n\\u3000\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\"\\n\\u3000\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of\\nDudley\\'s old things gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s\\nwhen I\\'ve finished.\"\\n\\u3000Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He\\nsat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to\\nlook on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of\\nold elephant skin, probably.\\n\\u3000Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses\\nbecause of the smell from Harry\\'s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened\\nhis newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which\\nhe carried everywhere, on the table.\\n\\u3000They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\\ndoormat.\\n\\u3000\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\n\\u3000\"Make Harry get it.\"\\n\\u3000\"Get the mail, Harry.\"\\n\\u3000\"Make Dudley get it.\"\\n\\u3000\"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\"\\n\\u3000Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three\\nthings lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister\\nMarge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope\\nthat looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.\\n\\u3000Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\\nelastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who\\nwould? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn\\'t belong to the\\nlibrary, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet\\nhere it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\\n\\u3000Mr. H. Potter\\n\\u3000The Cupboard under the Stairs\\n\\u30004 Privet Drive\\n\\u3000Little Whinging\\n\\u3000Surrey\\n\\u3000The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment,\\nand the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no\\nstamp.\\n\\u3000Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple\\nwax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a\\nsnake surrounding a large letter H.\\n\\u3000\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are\\nyou doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\\n\\u3000Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed\\nUncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to\\nopen the yellow envelope.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped\\nover the postcard.\\n\\u3000\"Marge\\'s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"\\n\\u3000\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!\"\\n\\u3000Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on\\nthe same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked\\nsharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\n\\u3000\"Who\\'d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter\\nopen with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to\\ngreen faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within\\nseconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.\\n\\u3000\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\\n\\u3000Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it\\nhigh out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first\\nline. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched\\nher throat and made a choking noise.\\n\\u3000\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"\\n\\u3000They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\'t used to being ignored.\\nHe gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\n\\u3000\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said\\nHarry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\"\\n\\u3000\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter\\nback inside its envelope.\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t move.\\n\\u3000I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\\n\\u3000\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.\\n\\u3000\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by\\nthe scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the\\nkitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious\\nbut silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so\\nHarry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to\\nlisten at the crack between door and floor.\\n\\u3000\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the\\naddress -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\'t\\nthink they\\'re watching the house?\"\\n\\u3000\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle\\nVernon wildly.\\n\\u3000\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them\\nwe don\\'t want --\"\\n\\u3000Harry could see Uncle Vernon\\'s shiny black shoes pacing up and\\ndown the kitchen.\\n\\u3000\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\'ll ignore it. If they don\\'t get an\\nanswer... Yes, that\\'s best... we won\\'t do anything....\\n\\u3000\"But --\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\'t we swear when we\\ntook him in we\\'d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\"\\n\\u3000That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did\\nsomething he\\'d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\n\\u3000\"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had\\nsqueezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\"\\n\\u3000\"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon\\nshortly. \"I have burned it.\"\\n\\u3000\"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on\\nit.\"\\n\\u3000\"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from\\nthe ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a\\nsmile, which looked quite painful.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\\nthinking... you\\'re really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be\\nnice if you moved into Dudley\\'s second bedroom.\\n\\u3000\"Why?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs,\\nnow.\"\\n\\u3000The Dursleys\\' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and\\nAunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\'s sister, Marge),\\none where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and\\nthings that wouldn\\'t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one\\ntrip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this\\nroom. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly\\neverything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying\\non top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next\\ndoor neighbor\\'s dog; in the corner was Dudley\\'s first-ever television\\nset, which he\\'d put his foot through when his favorite program had\\nbeen canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a\\nparrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which\\nwas up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it.\\nOther shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the\\nroom that looked as though they\\'d never been touched.\\n\\u3000From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I\\ndon\\'t want him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\\n\\u3000Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\'d have\\ngiven anything to be up here. Today he\\'d rather be back in his\\ncupboard with that letter than up here without it.\\n\\u3000Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was\\nin shock. He\\'d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick,\\nbeen sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise\\nthrough the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\\'t have his room back.\\nHarry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\\'d\\nopened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept\\nlooking at each other darkly.\\n\\u3000When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to\\nbe nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging\\nthings with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he\\nshouted, \"There\\'s another one! \\'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4\\nPrivet Drive --\\'\"\\n\\u3000With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran\\ndown the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle\\nDudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made\\ndifficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the\\nneck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which\\neveryone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon\\nstraightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\\'s letter clutched in his\\nhand.\\n\\u3000\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at\\nHarry. \"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\\n\\u3000Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he\\nhad moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\'t\\nreceived his first letter. Surely that meant they\\'d try again? And this\\ntime he\\'d make sure they didn\\'t fail. He had a plan.\\n\\u3000The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\'clock the next morning. Harry\\nturned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\'t wake the\\nDursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\n\\u3000He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive\\nand get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he\\ncrept across the dark hall toward the front door --\\n\\u3000Harry leapt into the air; he\\'d trodden on something big and squashy\\non the doormat -- something alive!\\n\\u3000Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the\\nbig, squashy something had been his uncle\\'s face. Uncle Vernon had\\nbeen lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly\\nmaking sure that Harry didn\\'t do exactly what he\\'d been trying to do.\\nHe shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go\\nand make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen\\nand by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\\nVernon\\'s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\n\\u3000I want --\" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\npieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He\\nstayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.\\n\\u3000\"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if\\nthey can\\'t deliver them they\\'ll just give up.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not sure that\\'ll work, Vernon.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, these people\\'s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\'re not\\nlike you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the\\npiece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\n\\u3000On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they\\ncouldn\\'t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the\\ndoor, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the\\nsmall window in the downstairs bathroom.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he\\ngot out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the\\nfront and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe\\nThrough the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises.\\n\\u3000On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to\\nHarry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside\\neach of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had\\nhanded Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle\\nVernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy\\ntrying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the\\nletters in her food processor.\\n\\u3000\"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry\\nin amazement.\\n\\u3000On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table\\nlooking tired and rather ill, but happy.\\n\\u3000\"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread\\nmarmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today --\"\\n\\u3000Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke\\nand caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty\\nor forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The\\nDursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.\\n\\u3000\"Out! OUT!\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the\\nhall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over\\ntheir faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the\\nletters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\n\\u3000\"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back\\nhere in five minutes ready to leave. We\\'re going away. Just pack some\\nclothes. No arguments!\"\\n\\u3000He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one\\ndared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through\\nthe boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the\\nhighway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him\\nround the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his\\ntelevision, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\\n\\u3000They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask\\nwhere they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take\\na sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake\\'em\\noff... shake \\'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this.\\n\\u3000They didn\\'t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was\\nhowling. He\\'d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry,\\nhe\\'d missed five television programs he\\'d wanted to see, and he\\'d\\nnever gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds\\nand damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake,\\nsitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars\\nand wondering....\\n\\u3000They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for\\nbreakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the\\nhotel came over to their table.\\n\\u3000\"\\'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an\\n\\'undred of these at the front desk.\"\\n\\u3000She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\\n\\u3000Mr. H. Potter\\n\\u3000Room 17\\n\\u3000Railview Hotel\\n\\u3000Cokeworth\\n\\u3000Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand\\nout of the way. The woman stared.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and\\nfollowing her from the dining room.\\n\\u3000Wouldn\\'t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested\\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\'t seem to hear her. Exactly\\nwhat he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the\\nmiddle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in\\nthe car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the\\nmiddle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at\\nthe top of a multilevel parking garage.\\n\\u3000\"Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully\\nlate that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked\\nthem all inside the car, and disappeared.\\n\\u3000It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley\\nsniveled.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight.\\nI want to stay somewhere with a television. \"\\n\\u3000Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and\\nyou could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week,\\nbecause of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\'s eleventh\\nbirthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year,\\nthe Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s\\nold socks. Still, you weren\\'t eleven every day.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a\\nlong, thin package and didn\\'t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked\\nwhat he\\'d bought.\\n\\u3000\"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\"\\n\\u3000It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock\\nwas the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was\\ncertain, there was no television in there.\\n\\u3000\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping\\nhis hands together. \"And this gentleman\\'s kindly agreed to lend us his\\nboat!\"\\n\\u3000A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a\\nrather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water\\nbelow them.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all\\naboard!\"\\n\\u3000It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their\\nnecks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like\\nhours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and\\nsliding, led the way to the broken-down house.\\n\\u3000The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was\\ndamp and empty. There were only two rooms.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon\\'s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked\\nand shriveled up.\\n\\u3000\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully.\\n\\u3000He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a\\nchance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry\\nprivately agreed, though the thought didn\\'t cheer him up at all.\\n\\u3000As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from\\nthe high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind\\nrattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets\\nin the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten\\nsofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and\\nHarry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up\\nunder the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\\n\\u3000The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on.\\nHarry couldn\\'t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get\\ncomfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\\'s snores were\\ndrowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The\\nlighted dial of Dudley\\'s watch, which was dangling over the edge of\\nthe sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\\'d be eleven in ten minutes\\'\\ntime. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the\\nDursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer\\nwas now.\\n\\u3000Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped\\nthe roof wasn\\'t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.\\nFour minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full\\nof letters when they got back that he\\'d be able to steal one somehow.\\n\\u3000Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock\\nlike that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching\\nnoise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?\\n\\u3000One minute to go and he\\'d be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ...\\nten... nine -- maybe he\\'d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three...\\ntwo... one...\\n\\u3000BOOM.\\n\\u3000The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the\\ndoor. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER FOUR: THE KEEPER OF THE\\nKEYS\\n\\u3000BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\'s the\\ncannon?\" he said stupidly.\\n\\u3000There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding\\ninto the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew\\nwhat had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.\\n\\u3000\"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you -- I\\'m armed!\"\\n\\u3000There was a pause. Then --\\n\\u3000SMASH!\\n\\u3000The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges\\nand with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\n\\u3000A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled\\nbeard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles\\nunder all the hair.\\n\\u3000The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head\\njust brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted\\nit easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a\\nlittle. He turned to look at them all.\\n\\u3000\"Couldn\\'t make us a cup o\\' tea, could yeh? It\\'s not been an easy\\njourney...\"\\n\\u3000He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\\n\\u3000\"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger.\\n\\u3000Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was\\ncrouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\n\\u3000\"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant.\\n\\u3000Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that\\nthe beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\n\\u3000\"Las\\' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look\\na lot like yet dad, but yeh\\'ve got yet mom\\'s eyes.\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\n\\u3000I demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \"You are breaking and\\nentering!\"\\n\\u3000\"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached\\nover the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands,\\nbent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and\\nthrew it into a corner of the room.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being\\ntrodden on.\\n\\u3000\"Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys,\\n\"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat\\non it at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\"\\n\\u3000From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly\\nsquashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a\\nlarge, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it\\nin green icing.\\n\\u3000Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the\\nwords got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was,\\n\"Who are you?\"\\n\\u3000The giant chuckled.\\n\\u3000\"True, I haven\\'t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys\\nand Grounds at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\u3000He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\\'s whole arm.\\n\\u3000\"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together.\\n\"I\\'d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\'ve got it, mind.\"\\n\\u3000His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it\\nand he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\\'t see\\nwhat he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a\\nroaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light\\nand Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\\'d sunk into a\\nhot bath.\\n\\u3000The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his\\nweight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his\\ncoat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot,\\nseveral chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took\\na swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the\\nsound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the\\ngiant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt\\nsausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\\nsharply, \"Don\\'t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\"\\n\\u3000The giant chuckled darkly.\\n\\u3000\"Yet great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley,\\ndon\\' worry.\"\\n\\u3000He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never\\ntasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the\\ngiant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,\\n\"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\"\\n\\u3000The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of\\nhis hand.\\n\\u3000\"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\\' like I told yeh, I\\'m\\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh\\'ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\'\\ncourse.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- no,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000Hagrid looked shocked.\\n\\u3000\"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly.\\n\\u3000\"Sony?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank\\nback into the shadows. \"It\\' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh\\nweren\\'t gettin\\' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\'t even know\\nabou\\' Hogwarts, fer cryin\\' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet\\nparents learned it all?\"\\n\\u3000\"All what?\" asked Harry.\\n\\u3000\"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus\\' one second!\"\\n\\u3000He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole\\nhut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.\\n\\u3000\"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy\\n-- this boy! -- knows nothin\\' abou\\' -- about ANYTHING?\"\\n\\u3000Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after\\nall, and his marks weren\\'t bad.\\n\\u3000\"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\"\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I\\nmean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\\' world.\"\\n\\u3000\"What world?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\n\\u3000\"DURSLEY!\" he boomed.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that\\nsounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\n\\u3000\"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean,\\nthey\\'re famous. You\\'re famous.\"\\n\\u3000\"What? My -- my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeh don\\' know... yeh don\\' know...\" Hagrid ran his fingers through\\nhis hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\n\\u3000\"Yeh don\\' know what yeh are?\" he said finally.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\n\\u3000\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the\\nboy anything!\"\\n\\u3000A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the\\nfurious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every\\nsyllable trembled with rage.\\n\\u3000\"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter\\nDumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it,\\nDursley! An\\' you\\'ve kept it from him all these years?\"\\n\\u3000\"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly.\\n\\u3000\"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\n\\u3000Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\n\\u3000\"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry -- yet a\\nwizard.\"\\n\\u3000There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling\\nwind could be heard.\\n\\u3000\"-- a what?\" gasped Harry.\\n\\u3000\"A wizard, o\\' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa,\\nwhich groaned and sank even lower, \"an\\' a thumpin\\' good\\'un, I\\'d say,\\nonce yeh\\'ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\\' dad like yours,\\nwhat else would yeh be? An\\' I reckon it\\'s abou\\' time yeh read yer\\nletter.\"\\n\\u3000Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\\naddressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-\\nRock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\n\\u3000HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\u3000Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\u3000(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme\\nMugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\n\\u3000Dear Mr. Potter,\\n\\u3000We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at\\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a\\nlist of all necessary books and equipment.\\n\\u3000Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than\\nJuly 31. Yours sincerely,\\n\\u3000Minerva McGonagall,\\n\\u3000Deputy Headmistress\\n\\u3000Questions exploded inside Harry\\'s head like fireworks and he\\ncouldn\\'t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered,\\n\"What does it mean, they await my owl?\"\\n\\u3000\"Gallopin\\' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand\\nto his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and\\nfrom yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real,\\nlive, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.\\nWith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry\\ncould read upside down:\\n\\u3000Dear Professor Dumbledore,\\n\\u3000Given Harry his letter.\\n\\u3000Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\n\\u3000Weather\\'s horrible. Hope you\\'re Well.\\n\\u3000Hagrid\\n\\u3000Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its\\nbeak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he\\ncame back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on\\nthe telephone.\\n\\u3000Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\n\\u3000\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s not going,\" he said.\\n\\u3000Hagrid grunted.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said.\\n\\u3000\"A what?\" said Harry, interested.\\n\\u3000\"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\\'s what we call nonmagic folk like thern.\\nAn\\' it\\'s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\' the biggest Muggles I\\never laid eyes on.\"\\n\\u3000\"We swore when we took him in we\\'d put a stop to that rubbish,\"\\nsaid Uncle Vernon, \"swore we\\'d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\"\\n\\u3000\"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I\\'m a -- a wizard?\"\\n\\u3000\"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we\\nknew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was?\\nOh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that\\nschool-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog\\nspawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for\\nwhat she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was\\nLily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the\\nfamily!\"\\n\\u3000She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It\\nseemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.\\n\\u3000\"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married\\nand had you, and of course I knew you\\'d be just the same, just as\\nstrange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went\\nand got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\"\\n\\u3000Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,\\n\"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\"\\n\\u3000\"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the\\nDursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily\\nan\\' James Potter? It\\'s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\'\\nhis own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But\\nwhy? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently.\\n\\u3000The anger faded from Hagrid\\'s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\n\\u3000\"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no\\nidea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\' hold of\\nyeh, how much yeh didn\\'t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\' know if I\\'m the\\nright person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can\\'t go off ter\\nHogwarts not knowin\\'.\"\\n\\u3000He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\n\\u3000\"Well, it\\'s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can\\'t\\ntell yeh everythin\\', it\\'s a great myst\\'ry, parts of it....\"\\n\\u3000He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It\\nbegins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it\\'s incredible yeh\\ndon\\'t know his name, everyone in our world knows --\"\\n\\u3000\"Who? \"\\n\\u3000\"Well -- I don\\' like sayin\\' the name if I can help it. No one does.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why not?\"\\n\\u3000\"Gulpin\\' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is\\ndifficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you\\ncould go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\n\\u3000\"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested.\\n\\u3000\"Nah -can\\'t spell it. All right -- Voldemort. \" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don\\'\\nmake me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years\\nago now, started lookin\\' fer followers. Got \\'em, too -- some were\\nafraid, some just wanted a bit o\\' his power, \\'cause he was gettin\\'\\nhimself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\\'t know who ter trust,\\ndidn\\'t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible\\nthings happened. He was takin\\' over. \\'Course, some stood up to him --\\nan\\' he killed \\'em. Horribly. One o\\' the only safe places left was\\nHogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was\\nafraid of. Didn\\'t dare try takin\\' the school, not jus\\' then, anyway.\\n\\u3000\"Now, yer mum an\\' dad were as good a witch an\\' wizard as I ever\\nknew. Head boy an\\' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\\'ry\\nis why You-Know-Who never tried to get \\'em on his side before...\\nprobably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\\'\\nter do with the Dark Side.\\n\\u3000\"Maybe he thought he could persuade \\'em... maybe he just wanted\\n\\'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village\\nwhere you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a\\nyear old. He came ter yer house an\\' -- an\\' --\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and\\nblew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\n\\u3000\"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it\\'s that sad -- knew yer mum an\\' dad, an\\' nicer\\npeople yeh couldn\\'t find -- anyway...\"\\n\\u3000\"You-Know-Who killed \\'em. An\\' then -- an\\' this is the real myst\\'ry of\\nthe thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it,\\nI suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\' by then. But he couldn\\'t do it.\\nNever wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no\\nordinary cut. That\\'s what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches\\nyeh -- took care of yer mum an\\' dad an\\' yer house, even -- but it didn\\'t\\nwork on you, an\\' that\\'s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after\\nhe decided ter kill \\'em, no one except you, an\\' he\\'d killed some o\\' the\\nbest witches an\\' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the\\nPrewetts -- an\\' you was only a baby, an\\' you lived.\"\\n\\u3000Something very painful was going on in Harry\\'s mind. As Hagrid\\'s\\nstory came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light,\\nmore clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he\\nremembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold,\\ncruel laugh.\\n\\u3000Hagrid was watching him sadly.\\n\\u3000\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\'s orders.\\nBrought yeh ter this lot...\"\\n\\u3000\"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost\\nforgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed\\nto have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists\\nwere clenched.\\n\\u3000\"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\\'s something\\nstrange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\'t have\\ncured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were\\nweirdos, no denying it, and the world\\'s better off without them in my\\nopinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these\\nwizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they\\'d come to a\\nsticky end --\"\\n\\u3000But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered\\npink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like\\na sword, he said, \"I\\'m warning you, Dursley -I\\'m warning you -- one\\nmore word... \"\\n\\u3000In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded\\ngiant, Uncle Vernon\\'s courage failed again; he flattened himself\\nagainst the wall and fell silent.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down\\non the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\n\\u3000Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\n\\u3000\"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?\"\\n\\u3000\"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried\\nter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\\'s the biggest myst\\'ry,\\nsee... he was gettin\\' more an\\' more powerful -- why\\'d he go?\\n\\u3000\"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had\\nenough human left in him to die. Some say he\\'s still out there, bidin\\'\\nhis time, like, but I don\\' believe it. People who was on his side came\\nback ter ours. Some of \\'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon\\nthey could\\'ve done if he was comin\\' back.\\n\\u3000\"Most of us reckon he\\'s still out there somewhere but lost his\\npowers. Too weak to carry on. \\'Cause somethin\\' about you finished\\nhim, Harry. There was somethin\\' goin\\' on that night he hadn\\'t counted\\non -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin\\' about you\\nstumped him, all right.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes,\\nbut Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there\\nhad been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly\\nbe? He\\'d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt\\nPetunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\'t they\\nbeen turned into warty toads every time they\\'d tried to lock him in his\\ncupboard? If he\\'d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world,\\nhow come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a\\nfootball?\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I\\ndon\\'t think I can be a wizard.\"\\n\\u3000To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\n\\u3000\"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared\\nor angry?\"\\n\\u3000Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every\\nodd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had\\nhappened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by\\nDudley\\'s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach...\\ndreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\\'d managed to\\nmake it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\\'t\\nhe got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\\'t he\\nset a boa constrictor on him?\\n\\u3000Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was\\npositively beaming at him.\\n\\u3000\"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you\\'ll be\\nright famous at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\u3000But Uncle Vernon wasn\\'t going to give in without a fight.\\n\\u3000\"Haven\\'t I told you he\\'s not going?\" he hissed. \"He\\'s going to\\nStonewall High and he\\'ll be grateful for it. I\\'ve read those letters and\\nhe needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --\"\\n\\u3000\"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\\'t stop him,\"\\ngrowled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an\\' James Potter\\' s son goin\\' ter Hogwarts!\\nYer mad. His name\\'s been down ever since he was born. He\\'s off ter\\nthe finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years\\nthere and he won\\'t know himself. He\\'ll be with youngsters of his own\\nsort, fer a change, an\\' he\\'ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts\\never had Albus Dumbled--\"\\n\\u3000\"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH\\nHIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon.\\n\\u3000But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and\\nwhirled it over his head, \"NEVER,\" he thundered, \"- INSULT- ALBUS-\\nDUMBLEDORE- IN- FRONT- OF- ME!\"\\n\\u3000He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at\\nDudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a\\nsharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot\\nwith his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he\\nturned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\'s tail poking through a\\nhole in his trousers.\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the\\nother room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the\\ndoor behind them.\\n\\u3000Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\\n\\u3000\"Shouldn\\'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn\\'t work\\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much\\nlike a pig anyway there wasn\\'t much left ter do.\"\\n\\u3000He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\\n\\u3000\"Be grateful if yeh didn\\'t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he\\nsaid. \"I\\'m -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\'. I was\\nallowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\' get yer letters to yeh an\\' stuff --\\none o\\' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\\n\\u3000\"Why aren\\'t you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter\\ntell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\\'\\neverything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,\\nDumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s gettin\\' late and we\\'ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid\\nloudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\\' that.\"\\n\\u3000He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\n\\u3000\"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\\' mind if it wriggles a bit, I\\nthink I still got a couple o\\' dormice in one o\\' the pockets.\"\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER FIVE: DIAGON ALLEY\\n\\u3000Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was\\ndaylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.\\n\\u3000\"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. \"I dreamed a giant called\\nHagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I\\nopen my eyes I\\'ll be at home in my cupboard.\"\\n\\u3000There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\n\\u3000And there\\'s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his\\nheart sinking. But he still didn\\'t open his eyes. It had been such a good\\ndream.\\n\\u3000Tap. Tap. Tap.\\n\\u3000\"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I\\'m getting up.\"\\n\\u3000He sat up and Hagrid\\'s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the\\ncollapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window,\\na newspaper held in its beak.\\n\\u3000Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large\\nballoon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and\\njerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top\\nof Hagrid, who didn\\'t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor\\nand began to attack Hagrid\\'s coat.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t do that.\"\\n\\u3000Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There\\'s an owl\\n\\u3000\"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\n\\u3000\"What?\"\\n\\u3000\"He wants payin\\' fer deliverin\\' the paper. Look in the pockets.\"\\nHagrid\\'s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of\\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...\\nfinally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\n\\u3000\"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily.\\n\\u3000\"Knuts?\"\\n\\u3000\"The little bronze ones.\"\\n\\u3000Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his\\nleg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.\\nThen he flew off through the open window.\\n\\u3000Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\n\\u3000\"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\\'\\nbuy all yer stuff fer school.\"\\n\\u3000Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He\\nhad just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy\\nballoon inside him had got a puncture.\\n\\u3000\"Um -- Hagrid?\"\\n\\u3000\"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\n\\u3000\"I haven\\'t got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night\\n... he won\\'t pay for me to go and learn magic.\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching\\nhis head. \"D\\'yeh think yer parents didn\\'t leave yeh anything?\"\\n\\u3000\"But if their house was destroyed --\"\\n\\u3000\"They didn\\' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us\\nis Gringotts. Wizards\\' bank. Have a sausage, they\\'re not bad cold -- an\\'\\nI wouldn\\' say no teh a bit o\\' yer birthday cake, neither.\"\\n\\u3000\"Wizards have banks?\"\\n\\u3000\"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\"\\n\\u3000Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\n\\u3000\"Goblins?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah -- so yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it, I\\'ll tell yeh that. Never\\nmess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer\\nanything yeh want ter keep safe -- \\'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter\\no\\' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts\\nbusiness.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do\\nimportant stuff fer him. Fetchin\\' you gettin\\' things from Gringotts --\\nknows he can trust me, see.\\n\\u3000\"Got everythin\\'? Come on, then.\"\\n\\u3000Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear\\nnow and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had\\nhired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\n\\u3000\"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another\\nboat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"Flew?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah -- but we\\'ll go back in this. Not s\\'pposed ter use magic now\\nI\\'ve got yeh.\"\\n\\u3000They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying\\nto imagine him flying.\\n\\u3000\"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another\\nof his sideways looks. \"If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would\\nyeh mind not mentionin\\' it at Hogwarts?\"\\n\\u3000\"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled\\nout the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat,\\nand they sped off toward land.\\n\\u3000\"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked.\\n\\u3000\"Spells -- enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\\nspoke. \"They say there\\'s dragons guardin\\' the highsecurity vaults. And\\nthen yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under\\nLondon, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\'d die of hunger tryin\\'\\nter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\"\\n\\u3000Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper,\\nthe Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people\\nliked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\'d\\nnever had so many questions in his life.\\n\\u3000\"Ministry o\\' Magic messin\\' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered,\\nturning the page.\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop\\nhimself.\\n\\u3000\"\\'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 \\'\\ncourse, but he\\'d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the\\njob. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls\\nevery morning, askin\\' fer advice.\"\\n\\u3000\"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\'s still\\nwitches an\\' wizards up an\\' down the country.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why?\"\\n\\u3000\"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone\\'d be wantin\\' magic solutions to their\\nproblems. Nah, we\\'re best left alone.\"\\n\\u3000At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.\\nHagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone\\nsteps onto the street.\\n\\u3000Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little\\ntown to the station. Harry couldn\\'t blame them. Not only was Hagrid\\ntwice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary\\nthings like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things\\nthese Muggles dream up, eh?\"\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say\\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\'d like a dragon.\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'d like one?\"\\n\\u3000\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.\"\\n\\u3000They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\\nminutes\\' time. Hagrid, who didn\\'t understand \"Muggle money,\" as he\\ncalled it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\n\\u3000People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats\\nand sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\n\\u3000\"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry\\ntook the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\n\\u3000\"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There\\'s a list there of everything yeh need.\"\\n\\u3000Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\'t noticed the night\\nbefore, and read:\\n\\u3000HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\n\\u3000UNIFORM\\n\\u3000First-year students will require:\\n\\u30001. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\\n\\u30002. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\\n\\u30003. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\\n\\u30004. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings)\\n\\u3000Please note that all pupils\\' clothes should carry name tags\\n\\u3000COURSE BOOKS\\n\\u3000All students should have a copy of each of the following:\\n\\u3000The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk\\n\\u3000A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot\\n\\u3000Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling\\n\\u3000A Beginners\\' Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch\\n\\u3000One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore\\n\\u3000Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger\\n\\u3000Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander\\n\\u3000The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble\\n\\u3000OTHER EQUIPMENT\\n\\u3000wand cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) set\\n\\u3000glass or crystal phials\\n\\u3000telescope set\\n\\u3000brass scales\\n\\u3000Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\\n\\u3000PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT\\nALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS\\n\\u3000\"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud.\\n\\u3000\"If yeh know where to go,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to\\nknow where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there\\nin an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the\\nUnderground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small\\nand the trains too slow.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as\\nthey climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road\\nlined with shops.\\n\\u3000Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had\\nto do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music\\nstores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked\\nas if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street\\nfull of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold\\nburied miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell\\nbooks and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the\\nDursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\'t known that the Dursleys had\\nno sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\\nthough everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry\\ncouldn\\'t help trusting him.\\n\\u3000\"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It\\'s a\\nfamous place.\"\\n\\u3000It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\'t pointed it out,\\nHarry wouldn\\'t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by\\ndidn\\'t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side\\nto the record shop on the other as if they couldn\\'t see the Leaky\\nCauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only\\nhe and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had\\nsteered him inside.\\n\\u3000For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women\\nwere sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them\\nwas smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the\\nold bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.\\nThe low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone\\nseemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the\\nbartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t, Tom, I\\'m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his\\ngreat hand on Harry\\'s shoulder and making Harry\\'s knees buckle.\\n\\u3000\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this\\nbe --?\"\\n\\u3000The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\n\\u3000\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what\\nan honor.\"\\n\\u3000He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and\\nseized his hand, tears in his eyes.\\n\\u3000\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The\\nold woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had\\ngone out. Hagrid was beaming.\\n\\u3000Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment,\\nHarry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky\\nCauldron.\\n\\u3000\"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\\'t believe I\\'m meeting you at last.\"\\n\\u3000\"So proud, Mr. Potter, I\\'m just so proud.\"\\n\\u3000\"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I\\'m all of a flutter.\"\\n\\u3000\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can\\'t tell you, Diggle\\'s the name, Dedalus\\nDiggle.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\'s top hat fell off\\nin his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"\\n\\u3000\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\\n\"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and\\nagain -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\n\\u3000A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of\\nhis eyes was twitching.\\n\\u3000\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be\\none of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\u3000\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\\'s hand,\\n\"c-can\\'t t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you.\"\\n\\u3000\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\"\\n\\u3000\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell,\\nas though he\\'d rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh,\\nP-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You\\'ll be g-getting all your\\nequipment, I suppose? I\\'ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on\\nvampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought.\\n\\u3000But the others wouldn\\'t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.\\nIt took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid\\nmanaged to make himself heard over the babble.\\n\\u3000\"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"\\n\\u3000Doris Crockford shook Harry\\'s hand one last time, and Hagrid led\\nthem through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where\\nthere was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.\\n\\u3000Hagrid grinned at Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Told yeh, didn\\'t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor\\nQuirrell was tremblin\\' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he\\'s usually\\ntremblin\\'.\"\\n\\u3000\"Is he always that nervous?\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was\\n\\u3000studyin\\' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some\\nfirsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest,\\nand there was a nasty bit o\\' trouble with a hag -- never been the same\\nsince. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where\\'s\\nme umbrella?\"\\n\\u3000Vampires? Hags? Harry\\'s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile,\\nwas counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\n\\u3000\"Three up... two across he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\"\\n\\u3000He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\n\\u3000The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a\\nsmall hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they\\nwere facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway\\nonto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.\\n\\u3000\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"\\n\\u3000He grinned at Harry\\'s amazement. They stepped through the\\narchway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway\\nshrink instantly back into solid wall.\\n\\u3000The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest\\nshop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-\\nStirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\n\\u3000\"Yeah, you\\'ll be needin\\' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer\\nmoney first.\"\\n\\u3000Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in\\nevery direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at\\neverything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people\\ndoing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was\\nshaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen\\nSickles an ounce, they\\'re mad....\"\\n\\u3000A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying\\nEeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy.\\nSeveral boys of about Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a\\nwindow with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say,\\n\"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops\\nselling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments\\nHarry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat\\nspleens and eels\\' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of\\nparchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....\\n\\u3000\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the\\nother little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing\\na uniform of scarlet and gold, was -\\n\\u3000\"Yeah, that\\'s a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the\\nwhite stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter\\nthan Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry\\nnoticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside.\\nNow they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with\\nwords engraved upon them:\\n\\u3000Enter, stranger, but take heed\\n\\u3000Of what awaits the sin of greed,\\n\\u3000For those who take, but do not earn,\\n\\u3000Must pay most dearly in their turn.\\n\\u3000So if you seek beneath our floors\\n\\u3000A treasure that was never yours,\\n\\u3000Thief, you have been warned, beware\\n\\u3000Of finding more than treasure there.\\n\\u3000\"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they\\nwere in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting\\non high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers,\\nweighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through\\neyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall,\\nand yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid\\nand Harry made for the counter.\\n\\u3000\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\'ve come ter take some\\nmoney outta Mr. Harry Potter\\'s safe.\"\\n\\u3000\"You have his key, Sir?\"\\n\\u3000\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits\\nover the goblin\\'s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose.\\nHarry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as\\nbig as glowing coals.\\n\\u3000\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\n\\u3000The goblin looked at it closely.\\n\\u3000\"That seems to be in order.\"\\n\\u3000\"An\\' I\\'ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said\\nHagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It\\'s about the YouKnow-\\nWhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\"\\n\\u3000The goblin read the letter carefully.\\n\\u3000\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have\\nSomeone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\\n\\u3000Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the\\ndog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook\\ntoward one of the doors leading off the hall.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\"\\nHarry asked.\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret.\\nHogwarts business. Dumbledore\\'s trusted me. More\\'n my job\\'s worth\\nter tell yeh that.\"\\n\\u3000Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected\\nmore marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway\\nlit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were\\nlittle railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart\\ncame hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid\\nwith some difficulty -- and were off.\\n\\u3000At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry\\ntried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it\\nwas impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,\\nbecause Griphook wasn\\'t steering.\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept\\nthem wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of\\na passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -\\nthey plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge\\nstalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.\\n\\u3000I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,\\n\"what\\'s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\\n\\u3000\"Stalagmite\\'s got an \\'m\\' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' ask me\\nquestions just now, I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\"\\n\\u3000He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a\\nsmall door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against\\nthe wall to stop his knees from trembling.\\n\\u3000Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing\\nout, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold\\ncoins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\n\\u3000\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\\n\\u3000All Harry\\'s -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\'t have known\\nabout this or they\\'d have had it from him faster than blinking. How\\noften had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And\\nall the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried\\ndeep under London.\\n\\u3000Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\n\\u3000\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles\\nto a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\'s easy enough. Right,\\nthat should be enough fer a couple o\\' terms, we\\'ll keep the rest safe for\\nyeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,\\nplease, and can we go more slowly?\"\\n\\u3000\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\\n\\u3000They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air\\nbecame colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They\\nwent rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the\\nside to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid\\ngroaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.\\n\\u3000Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\n\\u3000\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\\nwith one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\n\\u3000\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\'d be sucked\\nthrough the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.\\n\\u3000\"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\" Harry asked.\\n\\u3000\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty\\ngrin.\\n\\u3000Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security\\nvault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see\\nfabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was\\nempty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown\\npaper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside\\nhis coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to\\nask.\\n\\u3000\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\'t talk to me on the way\\nback, it\\'s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside\\nGringotts. Harry didn\\'t know where to run first now that he had a bag\\nfull of money. He didn\\'t have to know how many Galleons there were\\nto a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\\'d had in\\nhis whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.\\n\\u3000\"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward\\nMadam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh\\nmind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate\\nthem Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered\\nMadam Malkin\\'s shop alone, feeling nervous.\\n\\u3000Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\n\\u3000\"Hogwarts, clear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the\\nlot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. \"\\n\\u3000In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was\\nstanding on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black\\nrobes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a\\nlong robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.\\n\\u3000\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"My father\\'s next door buying my books and mother\\'s up the street\\nlooking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice.\\n\"Then I\\'m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\'t see\\nwhy first years can\\'t have their own. I think I\\'ll bully father into\\ngetting me one and I\\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\"\\n\\u3000Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\n\\u3000\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.\\n\\u3000\"No,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Play Quidditch at all?\"\\n\\u3000\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could\\nbe.\\n\\u3000\"I do -- Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my\\nhouse, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\"\\n\\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\n\\u3000\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know\\nI\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in\\nHufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'t you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry,\\nwishing he could say something a bit more interesting.\\n\\u3000\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the\\nfront window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and\\npointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy\\ndidn\\'t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t\\nhe?\"\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and\\nless every second.\\n\\u3000\"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\'s a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the\\nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do\\nmagic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\"\\n\\u3000\"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\\n\\u3000\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you?\\nWhere are your parents?\"\\n\\u3000\"They\\'re dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn\\'t feel much like going\\ninto the matter with this boy.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were\\nour kind, weren\\'t they?\"\\n\\u3000\"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\"\\n\\u3000\"I really don\\'t think they should let the other sort in, do you?\\nThey\\'re just not the same, they\\'ve never been brought up to know our\\nways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get\\nthe letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding\\nfamilies. What\\'s your surname, anyway?\"\\n\\u3000But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That\\'s you\\ndone, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to\\nthe boy, hopped down from the footstool.\\n\\u3000\"Well, I\\'ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.\\n\\u3000Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought\\nhim (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s up?\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills.\\nHarry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed\\ncolor as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid,\\nwhat\\'s Quidditch?\"\\n\\u3000\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know -- not knowin\\'\\nabout Quidditch!\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the\\npate boy in Madam Malkin\\'s.\\n\\u3000\"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\'t even be\\nallowed in.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\\'d known who yeh were -- he\\'s\\ngrown up knowin\\' yer name if his parents are wizardin\\' folk. You saw\\nwhat everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.\\nAnyway, what does he know about it, some o\\' the best I ever saw were\\nthe only ones with magic in \\'em in a long line 0\\' Muggles -- look at yer\\nmum! Look what she had fer a sister!\"\\n\\u3000\"So what is Quidditch?\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\'s like -- like soccer in the Muggle\\nworld -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on\\nbroomsticks and there\\'s four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules.\"\\n\"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\"\\n\\u3000\"School houses. There\\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\'\\nduffers, but --\"\\n\\u3000\"I bet I\\'m in Hufflepuff\" said Harry gloomily.\\n\\u3000\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\'s not a\\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\'t in Slytherin. You-\\nKnow-Who was one.\"\\n\\u3000\"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\"\\n\\u3000\"Years an\\' years ago,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000They bought Harry\\'s school books in a shop called Flourish and\\nBlotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as\\nlarge as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage\\nstamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few\\nbooks with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read\\nanything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these.\\nHagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses\\n(Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest\\nRevenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue- Tying and Much, Much\\nMore) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\n\\u3000\"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in\\nthe Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid.\\n\"An\\' anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of them curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a\\nlot more study before yeh get ter that level.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says\\npewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing\\npotion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited\\nthe Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its\\nhorrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of\\nslimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright\\npowders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and\\nsnarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man\\nbehind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for\\nHarry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one\\nGalleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a\\nscoop).\\n\\u3000Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\'s list again.\\n\\u3000\"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an\\' I still haven\\'t got yeh a birthday\\npresent.\"\\n\\u3000Harry felt himself go red.\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t have to --\"\\n\\u3000\"I know I don\\'t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\'ll get yer animal. Not a\\ntoad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\'d be laughed at - an\\' I\\ndon\\' like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\'ll get yer an owl. All the kids\\nwant owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\"\\n\\u3000Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had\\nbeen dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry\\nnow carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep\\nwith her head under her wing. He couldn\\'t stop stammering his\\nthanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\' expect you\\'ve had a\\nlotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only\\nplace fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\"\\n\\u3000A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking\\nforward to.\\n\\u3000The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the\\ndoor read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single\\nwand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\n\\u3000A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they\\nstepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly\\nchair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had\\nentered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that\\nhad just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of\\nnarrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the\\nback of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to\\ntingle with some secret magic.\\n\\u3000\"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must\\nhave jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he\\ngot quickly off the spindly chair.\\n\\u3000An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining\\nlike moons through the gloom of the shop.\\n\\u3000\"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly.\\n\\u3000\"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon.\\nHarry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. It\\nseems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand.\\nTen and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for\\ncharm work.\"\\n\\u3000Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would\\nblink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\n\\u3000\"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven\\ninches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration.\\nWell, I say your father favored it -- it\\'s really the wand that chooses\\nthe wizard, of course.\"\\n\\u3000Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost\\nnose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\n\\u3000\"And that\\'s where...\"\\n\\u3000Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead with\\na long, white finger.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly.\\n\"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and\\nin the wrong hands... well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out\\ninto the world to do....\"\\n\\u3000He shook his head and then, to Harry\\'s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen\\ninches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\"\\n\\u3000\"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when\\nyou got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I\\'ve still got\\nthe pieces, though,\" he added brightly.\\n\\u3000\"But you don\\'t use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, no, sit,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\n\\u3000\"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well,\\nnow -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with\\nsilver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\"\\n\\u3000\"Er -- well, I\\'m right-handed,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to\\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and\\nround his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has\\na core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn\\nhairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two\\nOllivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or\\nphoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such\\ngood results with another wizard\\'s wand.\"\\n\\u3000Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was\\nmeasuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr.\\nOllivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.\\n\\u3000\"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap\\non the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and\\ndragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give\\nit a wave.\"\\n\\u3000Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but\\nMr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\n\\u3000\"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --\"\\n\\u3000Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\\nsnatched back by Mr. Ollivander.\\n\\u3000\"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches,\\nspringy. Go on, go on, try it out.\"\\n\\u3000Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was\\nwaiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher\\non the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from\\nthe shelves, the happier he seemed to become.\\n\\u3000\"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\'ll find the perfect match\\nhere somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual\\ncombination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and\\nsupple.\"\\n\\u3000Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He\\nraised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the\\ndusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a\\nfirework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid\\nwhooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes,\\nindeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very\\ncurious... \"\\n\\u3000He put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown\\npaper, still muttering, \"Curious... curious..\\n\\u3000\"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what\\'s curious?\"\\n\\u3000Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\n\\u3000\"I remember every wand I\\'ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single\\nwand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your\\nwand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed\\nthat you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its\\nbrother gave you that scar.\"\\n\\u3000Harry swallowed.\\n\\u3000\"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these\\nthings happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we\\nmust expect great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He- Who-\\nMust-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.\"\\n\\u3000Harry shivered. He wasn\\'t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.\\nHe paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed\\nthem from his shop.\\n\\u3000The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid\\nmade their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back\\nthrough the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\'t speak at all as\\nthey walked down the road; he didn\\'t even notice how much people\\nwere gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with\\nall their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage\\non Harry\\'s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station;\\nHarry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the\\nshoulder.\\n\\u3000\"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said.\\n\\u3000He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to\\neat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange,\\nsomehow.\\n\\u3000\"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000Harry wasn\\'t sure he could explain. He\\'d just had the best birthday\\nof his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the\\nwords.\\n\\u3000\"Everyone thinks I\\'m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the\\nLeaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don\\'t know\\nanything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\'m\\nfamous and I can\\'t even remember what I\\'m famous for. I don\\'t know\\nwhat happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows\\nhe wore a very kind smile.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\' you worry, Harry. You\\'ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at\\nthe beginning at Hogwarts, you\\'ll be just fine. just be yerself. I know\\nit\\'s hard. Yeh\\'ve been singled out, an\\' that\\'s always hard. But yeh\\'ll\\nhave a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, \\'smatter of fact.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\n\\u3000\"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o\\' September -- King\\'s Cross\\n-- it\\'s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a\\nletter with yer owl, she\\'ll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,\\nHarry.\"\\n\\u3000The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid\\nuntil he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose\\nagainst the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER SIX: THE JOURNEY FROM\\nPLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s last month with the Dursleys wasn\\'t fun. True, Dudley was\\nnow so scared of Harry he wouldn\\'t stay in the same room, while Aunt\\nPetunia and Uncle Vernon didn\\'t shut Harry in his cupboard, force\\nhim to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn\\'t speak to him\\nat all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with\\nHarry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many\\nways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.\\n\\u3000Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had\\ndecided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of\\nMagic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed\\nreading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open\\nwindow as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\\'t come in\\nto vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.\\nEvery night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on\\nthe piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to\\nSeptember the first.\\n\\u3000On the last day of August he thought he\\'d better speak to his aunt\\nand uncle about getting to King\\'s Cross station the next day, so he\\nwent down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show\\non television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there,\\nand Dudley screamed and ran from the room.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- Uncle Vernon?\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- I need to be at King\\'s Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.\"\\n\\u3000Uncle Vernon grunted again.\\n\\u3000\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\"\\n\\u3000Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\n\\u3000\"Thank you.\"\\n\\u3000He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually\\nspoke.\\n\\u3000\"Funny way to get to a wizards\\' school, the train. Magic carpets all\\ngot punctures, have they?\"\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t say anything.\\n\\u3000\"Where is this school, anyway?\"\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled\\nthe ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\n\\u3000\"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven\\no\\'clock,\" he read.\\n\\u3000His aunt and uncle stared.\\n\\u3000\"Platform what?\"\\n\\u3000\"Nine and three-quarters.\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine\\nand three-quarters.\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s on my ticket.\"\\n\\u3000\"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You\\'ll\\nsee. You just wait. All right, we\\'ll take you to King\\'s Cross. We\\'re going\\nup to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\'t bother.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things\\nfriendly.\\n\\u3000\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have\\nthat ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"\\n\\u3000Harry woke at five o\\'clock the next morning and was too excited\\nand nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans\\nbecause he didn\\'t want to walk into the station in his wizard\\'s robes --\\nhe\\'d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to\\nmake sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut\\nsafely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys\\nto get up. Two hours later, Harry\\'s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded\\ninto the Dursleys\\' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next\\nto Harry, and they had set off.\\n\\u3000They reached King\\'s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped\\nHarry\\'s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.\\nHarry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped\\ndead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.\\n\\u3000\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your\\nplatform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\'t seem to\\nhave built it yet, do they?\"\\n\\u3000He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine\\nover one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it,\\nand in the middle, nothing at all.\\n\\u3000\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile.\\nHe left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys\\ndrive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\\'s mouth went\\nrather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to\\nattract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\\'d have to ask\\nsomeone.\\n\\u3000He stopped a passing guard, but didn\\'t dare mention platform nine\\nand three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when\\nHarry couldn\\'t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he\\nstarted to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.\\nGetting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\'clock,\\nbut the guard said there wasn\\'t one. In the end the guard strode away,\\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to\\npanic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten\\nminutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how\\nto do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he\\ncould hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\\n\\u3000Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do,\\nlike tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He\\nwondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket\\ninspector\\'s stand between platforms nine and ten.\\n\\u3000At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he\\ncaught a few words of what they were saying.\\n\\u3000\"-- packed with Muggles, of course --\"\\n\\u3000Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was\\ntalking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was\\npushing a trunk like Harry\\'s in front of him -- and they had an owl.\\n\\u3000Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped\\nand so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\n\\u3000\"Now, what\\'s the platform number?\" said the boys\\' mother.\\n\\u3000\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who\\nwas holding her hand, \"Mom, can\\'t I go... \"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you\\ngo first.\"\\n\\u3000What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and\\nten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just\\nas the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a\\nlarge crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time\\nthe last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.\\n\\u3000\"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not Fred, I\\'m George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call\\nyourself our mother? CarA you tell I\\'m George?\"\\n\\u3000\"Sorry, George, dear.\"\\n\\u3000\"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin\\ncalled after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a\\nsecond later, he had gone -- but how had he done it?\\n\\u3000Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he\\nwas almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\'t anywhere.\\n\\u3000There was nothing else for it.\\n\\u3000\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman.\\n\\u3000\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\'s new, too.\"\\n\\u3000She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin,\\nand gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is -- the thing is, I don\\'t know how to\\n--\"\\n\\u3000\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\\n\\u3000\"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the\\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\'t stop and don\\'t be scared\\nyou\\'ll crash into it, that\\'s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if\\nyou\\'re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\"\\n\\u3000\"Er -- okay,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked\\nvery solid.\\n\\u3000He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to\\nplatforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to\\nsmash right into that barrier and then he\\'d be in trouble -- leaning\\nforward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was\\ncoming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn\\'t be able to stop -- the cart was\\nout of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the\\ncrash --\\n\\u3000It didn\\'t come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet\\nsteam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A\\nsign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O\\'clock. Harry looked\\nbehind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had\\nbeen, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had\\ndone it.\\n\\u3000Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering\\ncrowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their\\nlegs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the\\nbabble and the scraping of heavy trunks.\\n\\u3000The first few carriages were already packed with students, some\\nhanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over\\nseats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an\\nempty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I\\'ve\\nlost my toad again.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\\n\\u3000A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\\n\\u3000\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\\n\\u3000The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around\\nhim shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy\\nleg.\\n\\u3000Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\\ncompartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and\\nthen started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He\\ntried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he\\ndropped it painfully on his foot.\\n\\u3000\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he\\'d followed\\nthrough the barrier.\\n\\u3000\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\\n\\u3000\"Oy, Fred! C\\'mere and help!\"\\n\\u3000With the twins\\' help, Harry\\'s trunk was at last tucked away in a\\ncorner of the compartment.\\n\\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\'s\\nlightning scar.\\n\\u3000\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you\\n\\u3000\"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren\\'t you?\" he added to Harry.\\n\\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Harry Potter, \"chorused the twins.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\"\\n\\u3000The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red.\\nThen, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\'s open\\ndoor.\\n\\u3000\"Fred? George? Are you there?\"\\n\\u3000\"Coming, Mom.\"\\n\\u3000With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\n\\u3000Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could\\nwatch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were\\nsaying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\n\\u3000\"Ron, you\\'ve got something on your nose.\"\\n\\u3000The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him\\nand began rubbing the end of his nose.\\n\\u3000\"Mom -- geroff\" He wriggled free.\\n\\u3000\"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the\\ntwins.\\n\\u3000\"Shut up,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s coming now.\"\\n\\u3000The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed\\ninto his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny\\nsilver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have\\ngot two compartments to themselves --\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of\\ngreat surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\"\\n\\u3000\"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said\\nthe other twin. \"Once --\"\\n\\u3000\"Or twice --\"\\n\\u3000\"A minute --\"\\n\\u3000\"All summer --\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect.\\n\\u3000\"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins.\\n\\u3000\"Because he\\'s a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear,\\nwell, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.\"\\n\\u3000She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the\\ntwins.\\n\\u3000\"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more\\nowl telling me you\\'ve -- you\\'ve blown up a toilet or --\"\\n\\u3000\"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\"\\n\\u3000\"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not funny. And look after Ron.\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\"\\n\\u3000\"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already\\nand his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\n\\u3000\"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\"\\n\\u3000Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\\'t see him looking.\\n\\u3000\"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?\\nKnow who he is?\"\\n\\u3000\"Who?\"\\n\\u3000\"Harry Potter!\"\\n\\u3000Harry heard the little girl\\'s voice.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\'t something\\nyou goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\"\\n\\u3000\"Asked him. Saw his scar. It\\'s really there - like lightning.\"\\n\\u3000\"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so\\npolite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\"\\n\\u3000\"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who\\nlooks like?\"\\n\\u3000Their mother suddenly became very stern.\\n\\u3000\"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\'t you dare. As though he\\nneeds reminding of that on his first day at school.\"\\n\\u3000\"All right, keep your hair on.\"\\n\\u3000A whistle sounded.\\n\\u3000\"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto\\nthe train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-\\nbye, and their younger sister began to cry.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t, Ginny, we\\'ll send you loads of owls.\"\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\"\\n\\u3000\"George!\"\\n\\u3000\"Only joking, Mom.\"\\n\\u3000The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\' mother waving and\\ntheir sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the\\ntrain until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\n\\u3000Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train\\nrounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a\\ngreat leap of excitement. He didn\\'t know what he was going to but it\\nhad to be better than what he was leaving behind.\\n\\u3000The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded\\nboy came in.\\n\\u3000\"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite\\nHarry. \"Everywhere else is full.\"\\n\\u3000Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry\\nand then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\'t\\nlooked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.\\n\\u3000\"Hey, Ron.\"\\n\\u3000The twins were back.\\n\\u3000\"Listen, we\\'re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan\\'s got\\na giant tarantula down there.\"\\n\\u3000\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and\\nGeorge Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\\n\\u3000\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door\\nshut behind them.\\n\\u3000\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out.\\n\\u3000Harry nodded.\\n\\u3000\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said\\nRon. \"And have you really got -- you know...\"\\n\\u3000He pointed at Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\\u3000Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\n\\u3000\"So that\\'s where You-Know-Who\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\'t remember it.\"\\n\\u3000\"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly.\\n\\u3000\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"\\n\\u3000\"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments,\\nthen, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he\\nlooked quickly out of the window again.\\n\\u3000\"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as\\ninteresting as Ron found him.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin\\nwho\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"\\n\\u3000\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"\\n\\u3000The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the\\npale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\n\\u3000\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they\\nlike?\"\\n\\u3000\"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\\nthough. Wish I\\'d had three wizard brothers.\"\\n\\u3000\"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\'m the\\nsixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\'ve got a lot to\\nlive up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and\\nCharlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\'s a prefect. Fred and\\nGeorge mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and\\neveryone thinks they\\'re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as\\nwell as the others, but if I do, it\\'s no big deal, because they did it first.\\nYou never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\\'ve got Bill\\'s\\nold robes, Charlie\\'s old wand, and Percy\\'s old rat.\"\\n\\u3000Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which\\nwas asleep.\\n\\u3000\"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up.\\nPercy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they\\ncouldn\\'t aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"\\n\\u3000Ron\\'s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\'d said too much,\\nbecause he went back to staring out of the window.\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with not being able to\\nafford an owl. After all, he\\'d never had any money in his life until a\\nmonth ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\'s old\\nclothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to\\ncheer Ron up.\\n\\u3000\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about be ing a\\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort\"\\n\\u3000Ron gasped.\\n\\u3000\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked\\nand impressed. \"I\\'d have thought you, of all people --\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said\\nHarry, I just never knew you shouldn\\'t. See what I mean? I\\'ve got\\nloads to learn.... I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something\\nthat had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I\\'m the worst in the\\nclass.\"\\n\\u3000\"You won\\'t be. There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle\\nfamilies and they learn quick enough.\"\\n\\u3000While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of\\nLondon. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.\\nThey were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\n\\u3000Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,\\n\"Anything off the cart, dears?\"\\n\\u3000Harry, who hadn\\'t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\'s ears\\nwent pink again and he muttered that he\\'d brought sandwiches. Harry\\nwent out into the corridor.\\n\\u3000He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now\\nthat he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy\\nas many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn\\'t have\\nMars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans,\\nDrooble\\'s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties,\\nCauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things\\nHarry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got\\nsome of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and\\nseven bronze Knuts.\\n\\u3000Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and\\ntipped it onto an empty seat.\\n\\u3000\"Hungry, are you?\"\\n\\u3000\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\\n\\u3000Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were\\nfour sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She\\nalways forgets I don\\'t like corned beef.\"\\n\\u3000\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on\\n--\"\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t want this, it\\'s all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn\\'t got much\\ntime,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"\\n\\u3000\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to\\nshare before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,\\nsitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\'s pasties,\\ncakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).\\n\\u3000\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate\\nFrogs. \"They\\'re not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that\\nnothing would surprise him.\\n\\u3000\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\'m missing Agrippa.\"\\n\\u3000\"What?\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards,\\ninside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve\\ngot about five hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"\\n\\u3000Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It\\nshowed a man\\'s face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked\\nnose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the\\npicture was the name Albus Dumbledore.\\n\\u3000\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I\\nhave a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\\n\\u3000Harry turned over his card and read:\\n\\u3000ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\n\\u3000CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\n\\u3000Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,\\nDumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard\\nGrindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s\\nblood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.\\nProfessor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\\n\\u3000Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\\nDumbledore\\'s face had disappeared.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s gone!\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, you can\\'t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\'ll\\nbe back. No, I\\'ve got Morgana again and I\\'ve got about six of her... do\\nyou want it? You can start collecting.\"\\n\\u3000Ron\\'s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\\nunwrapped.\\n\\u3000\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world,\\npeople just stay put in photos.\"\\n\\u3000\"Do they? What, they don\\'t move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed.\\n\"weird!\"\\n\\u3000Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card\\nand gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the\\nfrogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but\\nHarry couldn\\'t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only\\nDumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic\\nGrunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away\\nfrom the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag\\nof Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans.\\n\\u3000\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they\\nsay every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the\\nordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but\\nthen you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a\\nbooger- flavored one once.\"\\n\\u3000Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a\\ncorner.\\n\\u3000\"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.\"\\n\\u3000They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got\\ntoast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine,\\nand was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one\\nRon wouldn\\'t touch, which turned out to be pepper.\\n\\u3000The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.\\nThe neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and\\ndark green hills.\\n\\u3000There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-\\nfaced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came\\nin. He looked tearful.\\n\\u3000\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"\\n\\u3000When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I\\'ve lost him! He keeps\\ngetting away from me!\"\\n\\u3000\"He\\'ll turn up,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him...\"\\n\\u3000He left.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t know why he\\'s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\'d brought a toad\\nI\\'d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\'t\\ntalk.\"\\n\\u3000The rat was still snoozing on Ron\\'s lap.\\n\\u3000\"He might have died and you wouldn\\'t know the difference,\" said\\nRon in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him\\nmore interesting, but the spell didn\\'t work. I\\'ll show you, look...\"\\n\\u3000He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-\\nlooking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was\\nglinting at the end.\\n\\u3000\"Unicorn hair\\'s nearly poking out. Anyway\\n\\u3000He had just raised his \\'wand when the compartment door slid open\\nagain. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with\\nhim. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\n\\u3000\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\\'s lost one,\" she said. She had a\\nbossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front\\nteeth.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve already told him we haven\\'t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl\\nwasn\\'t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\"\\n\\u3000She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- all right.\"\\n\\u3000He cleared his throat.\\n\\u3000\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"\\n\\u3000He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray\\nand fast asleep.\\n\\u3000\"Are you sure that\\'s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\'s not very\\ngood, is it? I\\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\'s all\\nworked for me. Nobody in my family\\'s magic at all, it was ever such a\\nsurprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I\\nmean, it\\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\'ve heard -- I\\'ve\\nlearned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be\\nenough -- I\\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.\\n\\u3000She said all this very fast.\\n\\u3000Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face\\nthat he hadn\\'t learned all the course books by heart either.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\\n\\u3000\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course -- I\\ngot a few extra books. for background reading, and you\\'re in Modern\\nMagical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great\\nWizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\\n\\u3000\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.\\n\\u3000\"Goodness, didn\\'t you know, I\\'d have found out everything I could if\\nit was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\'ll\\nbe in? I\\'ve been asking around, and I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor, it sounds\\nby far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose\\nRavenclaw wouldn\\'t be too bad.... Anyway, we\\'d better go and look for\\nNeville\\'s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\'ll be\\nthere soon.\"\\n\\u3000And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\n\\u3000\"Whatever house I\\'m in, I hope she\\'s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw\\nhis wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet\\nhe knew it was a dud.\"\\n\\u3000\"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\\n\"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\'t know what they\\'ll say if I\\'m not.\\nI don\\'t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put\\nme in Slytherin.\"\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\n\\u3000\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\' whiskers are a bit lighter,\"\\nsaid Harry, trying to take Ron\\'s mind off houses. \"So what do your\\noldest brothers do now that they\\'ve left, anyway?\"\\n\\u3000Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\'d finished school.\\n\\u3000\"Charlie\\'s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\'s in Africa doing\\nsomething for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about\\n\\u3000Gringotts? It\\'s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\'t suppose\\nyou get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security\\nvault.\"\\n\\u3000Harry stared.\\n\\u3000\"Really? What happened to them?\"\\n\\u3000\"Nothing, that\\'s why it\\'s such big news. They haven\\'t been caught.\\nMy dad says it must\\'ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round\\nGringotts, but they don\\'t think they took anything, that\\'s what\\'s odd.\\n\\'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in\\ncase You-Know-Who\\'s behind it.\"\\n\\u3000Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a\\nprickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He\\nsupposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had\\nbeen a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- I don\\'t know any,\" Harry confessed.\\n\\u3000\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\'s the best game\\nin the world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and\\nthe positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\'d been\\nto with his brothers and the broomstick he\\'d like to get if he had the\\nmoney. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game\\nwhen the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\'t Neville\\nthe toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.\\n\\u3000Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it\\nwas the pale boy from Madam Malkin\\'s robe shop. He was looking at\\nHarry with a lot more interest than he\\'d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\n\\u3000\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry\\nPotter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them\\nwere thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of\\nthe pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\\nnoticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\'s Malfoy, Draco\\nMalfoy.\"\\n\\u3000Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget.\\nDraco Malfoy looked at him.\\n\\u3000\"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\\nfather told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more\\nchildren than they can afford.\"\\n\\u3000He turned back to Harry. \"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding\\nfamilies are much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go\\nmaking friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\"\\n\\u3000He held out his hand to shake Harry\\'s, but Harry didn\\'t take it.\\n\\u3000\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said\\ncoolly.\\n\\u3000Draco Malfoy didn\\'t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale\\ncheeks.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a\\nbit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t know\\nwhat was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the\\nWeasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\"\\n\\u3000Both Harry and Ron stood up.\\n\\u3000\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, you\\'re going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.\\n\\u3000\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt,\\nbecause Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\\n\\u3000\"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our\\nfood and you still seem to have some.\"\\n\\u3000Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt\\nforward, but before he\\'d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a\\nhorrible yell.\\n\\u3000Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk\\ndeep into Goyle\\'s knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle\\nswung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally\\nflew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once.\\nPerhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets,\\nor perhaps they\\'d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione\\nGranger had come in.\\n\\u3000\"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over\\nthe floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\\n\\u3000I think he\\'s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer\\nat Scabbers. \"No -- I don\\'t believe it -- he\\'s gone back to sleep-\"\\n\\u3000And so he had.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\"\\n\\u3000Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the\\nfirst to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said\\nthey\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s\\nfather didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to\\nHermione. \"Can we help you with something?\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to\\nthe front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You\\nhaven\\'t been fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even\\nget there!\"\\n\\u3000\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her.\\n\"Would you mind leaving while we change?\"\\n\\u3000\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving\\nvery childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a\\nsniffy voice. \"And you\\'ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you\\nknow?\"\\n\\u3000Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It\\nwas getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep\\npurple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.\\n\\u3000He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black\\nrobes. Ron\\'s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers\\nunderneath them.\\n\\u3000A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in\\nfive minutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be\\ntaken to the school separately.\"\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale\\nunder his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the\\nsweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.\\n\\u3000The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed\\ntheir way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry\\nshivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the\\nheads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs\\' years!\\nFirs\\' years over here! All right there, Harry?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid\\'s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\\n\\u3000\"C\\'mon, follow me -- any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\'\\nyears follow me!\"\\n\\u3000Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to\\nbe a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that\\nHarry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much.\\nNeville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.\\n\\u3000\"Ye\\' all get yer firs\\' sight o\\' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over\\nhis shoulder, \"jus\\' round this bend here.\"\\n\\u3000There was a loud \"Oooooh!\"\\n\\u3000The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great\\nblack take. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its\\nwindows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many\\nturrets and towers.\\n\\u3000\"No more\\'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\\nboats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed\\ninto their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted\\nHagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then -- FORWARD!\"\\n\\u3000And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the\\nlake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at\\nthe great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer\\nand nearer to the cliff on which it stood.\\n\\u3000\"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they\\nall bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain\\nof ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried\\nalong a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath\\nthe castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where\\nthey clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\\n\\u3000\"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking\\nthe boats as people climbed out of them.\\n\\u3000\"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\'s lamp, coming\\nout at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\n\\u3000They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the\\nhuge, Oak front door.\\n\\u3000\"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle\\ndoor.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER SEVEN: THE SORTING HAT\\n\\u3000The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-\\ngreen robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first\\nthought was that this was not someone to cross.\\n\\u3000\"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"\\n\\u3000She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could\\nhave fit the whole of the Dursleys\\' house in it. The stone walls were lit\\nwith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too\\nhigh to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led\\nto the upper floors.\\n\\u3000They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.\\nHarry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to\\nthe right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor\\nMcGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the\\nhall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they\\nwould usually have done, peering about nervously.\\n\\u3000\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-\\nterm banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the\\nGreat Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very\\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be\\nsomething like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes\\nwith the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend\\nfree time in your house common room.\\n\\u3000\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has\\nproduced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at\\nHogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any\\nrulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house\\nwith the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope\\neach of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\n\\u3000\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of\\nthe rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much\\nas you can while you are waiting.\"\\n\\u3000Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\'s cloak, which was\\nfastened under his left ear, and on Ron\\'s smudged nose. Harry\\nnervously tried to flatten his hair.\\n\\u3000\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\"\\n\\u3000She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\n\\u3000\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\njoking.\"\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\\nschool? But he didn\\'t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he\\nhave to do? He hadn\\'t expected something like this the moment they\\narrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else\\nlooked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione\\nGranger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\\'d\\nlearned and wondering which one she\\'d need. Harry tried hard not to\\nlisten to her. He\\'d never been more nervous, never, not even when\\nhe\\'d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\\'d\\nsomehow turned his teacher\\'s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the\\ndoor. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and\\nlead him to his doom.\\n\\u3000Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the\\nair -- several people behind him screamed.\\n\\u3000\"What the --?\"\\n\\u3000He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had\\njust streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly\\ntransparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and\\nhardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What\\nlooked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we\\nought to give him a second chance --\"\\n\\u3000\"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?\\nHe gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost\\n-- I say, what are you all doing here?\"\\n\\u3000A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first\\nyears.\\n\\u3000Nobody answered.\\n\\u3000\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About\\nto be Sorted, I suppose?\"\\n\\u3000A few people nodded mutely.\\n\\u3000\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you\\nknow.\"\\n\\u3000\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s\\nabout to start.\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated\\naway through the opposite wall.\\n\\u3000\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and\\nfollow me.\"\\n\\u3000Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into\\nline behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they\\nwalked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of\\ndouble doors into the Great Hall.\\n\\u3000Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.\\nIt was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in\\nmidair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were\\nsitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and\\ngoblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the\\nteachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here,\\nso that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the\\nteachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked\\nlike pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there\\namong the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all\\nthe staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling\\ndotted with stars. He heard\\n\\u3000Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read\\nabout it in Hogwarts, A History.\"\\n\\u3000It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the\\nGreat Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens.\\n\\u3000Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently\\nplaced a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the\\nstool she put a pointed wizard\\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed\\nand extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\'t have let it in the house.\\n\\u3000Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought\\nwildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the\\nhall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds,\\nthere was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim\\nopened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\\n\\u3000\"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty,\\n\\u3000But don\\'t judge on what you see,\\n\\u3000I\\'ll eat myself if you can find\\n\\u3000A smarter hat than me.\\n\\u3000You can keep your bowlers black,\\n\\u3000Your top hats sleek and tall,\\n\\u3000For I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\n\\u3000And I can cap them all.\\n\\u3000There\\'s nothing hidden in your head\\n\\u3000The Sorting Hat can\\'t see,\\n\\u3000So try me on and I will tell you\\n\\u3000Where you ought to be.\\n\\u3000You might belong in Gryffindor,\\n\\u3000Where dwell the brave at heart,\\n\\u3000Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;\\n\\u3000You might belong in Hufflepuff,\\n\\u3000Where they are just and loyal,\\n\\u3000Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\\n\\u3000Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\n\\u3000if you\\'ve a ready mind,\\n\\u3000Where those of wit and learning,\\n\\u3000Will always find their kind;\\n\\u3000Or perhaps in Slytherin\\n\\u3000You\\'ll make your real friends,\\n\\u3000Those cunning folk use any means\\n\\u3000To achieve their ends.\\n\\u3000So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid!\\n\\u3000And don\\'t get in a flap!\\n\\u3000You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none)\\n\\u3000For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\"\\n\\u3000The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It\\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\n\\u3000\"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll\\nkill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\\n\\u3000Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than\\nhaving to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on\\nwithout everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;\\nHarry didn\\'t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If\\nonly the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,\\nthat would have been the one for him.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\\nparchment.\\n\\u3000\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool\\nto be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\\n\\u3000A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on\\nthe hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A\\nmoments pause --\\n\\u3000\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.\\n\\u3000The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit\\ndown at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar\\nwaving merrily at her.\\n\\u3000\"Bones, Susan!\"\\n\\u3000\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit\\nnext to Hannah.\\n\\u3000\"Boot, Terry!\"\\n\\u3000\"RAVENCLAW!\"\\n\\u3000The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\n\\u3000\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown,\\nLavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far\\nleft exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers\\ncatcalling.\\n\\u3000\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was\\nHarry\\'s imagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he\\nthought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel\\ndefinitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during\\ngym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not\\nbecause he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think\\nthey liked him.\\n\\u3000\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\\n\\u3000\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\\n\\u3000Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once,\\nbut at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the\\nsandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost\\na whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\\n\\u3000\"Granger, Hermione!\"\\n\\u3000Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on\\nher head.\\n\\u3000\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\n\\u3000A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do\\nwhen you\\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\\'t chosen at all? What if he\\njust sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor\\nMcGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a\\nmistake and he\\'d better get back on the train?\\n\\u3000When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was\\ncalled, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to\\ndecide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville\\nran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to\\ngive it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\"\\n\\u3000Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his\\nwish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed,\\n\"SLYTHERIN!\"\\n\\u3000Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased\\nwith himself.\\n\\u3000There weren\\'t many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then\\na pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and\\nthen, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"\\n\\u3000As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little\\nhissing fires all over the hall.\\n\\u3000\"Potter, did she say?\"\\n\\u3000The Harry Potter?\"\\n\\u3000The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was\\nthe hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second\\nhe was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\n\\u3000Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty\\nof courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\'s talent, A my\\ngoodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\'s\\ninteresting.... So where shall I put you?\"\\n\\u3000Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not\\nSlytherin.\\n\\u3000\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could\\nbe great, you know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help\\nyou on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you\\'re\\nsure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"\\n\\u3000Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took\\noff the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so\\nrelieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly\\nnoticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got\\nup and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled,\\n\"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in\\nthe ruff he\\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the\\nsudden, horrible feeling he\\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold\\nwater.\\n\\u3000He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him\\nsat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry\\ngrinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large\\ngold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from\\nthe card he\\'d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train.\\nDumbledore\\'s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that\\nshone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too,\\nthe nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very\\npeculiar in a large purple turban.\\n\\u3000And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas,\\nDean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the\\nGryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was\\nRon\\'s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under\\nthe table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"\\n\\u3000Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair\\nnext to him.\\n\\u3000\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across\\nHarry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall\\nrolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\n\\u3000Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just\\nrealized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\n\\u3000Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the\\nstudents, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him\\nmore than to see them all there.\\n\\u3000\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we\\nbegin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are:\\nNitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\n\\u3000\"Thank you!\"\\n\\u3000He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\\'t\\nknow whether to laugh or not.\\n\\u3000\"Is he -- a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.\\n\\u3000\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He\\'s a genius! Best wizard in the world!\\nBut he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled\\nwith food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one\\ntable: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages,\\nbacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire\\npudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason,\\npeppermint humbugs.\\n\\u3000The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\'d never been\\nallowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything\\nthat Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his\\nplate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to\\neat. It was all delicious.\\n\\u3000\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching\\nHarry cut up his steak,\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t you --?\"\\n\\u3000I haven\\'t eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I\\ndon\\'t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\'t think I\\'ve in\\ntroduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.\\nResident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"\\n\\u3000\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me\\nabout you -- you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\"\\n\\u3000\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost\\nbegan stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\n\\u3000\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\"\\n\\u3000Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\'t\\ngoing at all the way he wanted.\\n\\u3000\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His\\nwhole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was\\non a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done\\nit properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly\\nHeadless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,\\n\"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the house\\nchampionship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without\\nwinning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody\\nBaron\\'s becoming almost unbearable -- he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\"\\n\\u3000Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost\\nsitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained\\nwith silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased\\nto see, didn\\'t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\\n\\u3000\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great\\ninterest.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\n\\u3000When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the\\nfood faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A\\nmoment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every\\nflavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs\\nand jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\\n\\u3000As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their\\nfamilies.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad\\'s a Muggle. Mom didn\\'t\\ntell him she was a witch \\'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty\\nshock for him.\"\\n\\u3000The others laughed.\\n\\u3000\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but\\nthe family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie\\nkept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me\\n-- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned\\n-- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came\\nround for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window\\nby the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and\\nhe accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden\\nand into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she\\nwas so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here\\n-- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great\\nUncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\\n\\u3000On Harry\\'s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking\\nabout lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there\\'s so much to\\nlearn, I\\'m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning\\nsomething into something else, of course, it\\'s supposed to be very\\ndifficult-\"; \"You\\'ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that\\nsort of thing -- \").\\n\\u3000Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\\n\\u3000the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.\\nProfessor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor\\nQuirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy\\nblack hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\n\\u3000It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past\\nQuirrell\\'s turban straight into Harry\\'s eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot\\nacross the scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\\u3000\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\n\\u3000\"What is it?\" asked Percy.\\n\\u3000\"N-nothing.\"\\n\\u3000The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off\\nwas the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\'s look -- a feeling\\nthat he didn\\'t like Harry at all.\\n\\u3000\"Who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so\\nnervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t\\nwant to -- everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot\\nabout the Dark Arts, Snape.\"\\n\\u3000Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\\'t look at him\\nagain.\\n\\u3000At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got\\nto his feet again. The hall fell silent.\\n\\u3000\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and\\nwatered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\n\\u3000\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden\\nto all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to\\nremember that as well.\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore\\'s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\\ntwins.\\n\\u3000\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you\\nall that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\n\\u3000\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.\\nAnyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact\\nMadam Hooch.\\n\\u3000\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor\\non the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish\\nto die a very painful death.\"\\n\\u3000Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.\\n\\u3000\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he\\nusually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere --\\nthe forest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think\\nhe might have told us prefects, at least.\"\\n\\u3000\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried\\nDumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\' smiles had become\\nrather fixed.\\n\\u3000Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a\\nfly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose\\nhigh above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\n\\u3000\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we\\ngo!\" And the school bellowed:\\n\\u3000\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\n\\u3000Teach us something please,\\n\\u3000Whether we be old and bald\\n\\u3000Or young with scabby knees,\\n\\u3000Our heads could do with filling\\n\\u3000With some interesting stuff,\\n\\u3000For now they\\'re bare and full of air,\\n\\u3000Dead flies and bits of fluff,\\n\\u3000So teach us things worth knowing,\\n\\u3000Bring back what we\\'ve forgot,\\n\\u3000just do your best, we\\'ll do the rest,\\n\\u3000And learn until our brains all rot.\\n\\u3000Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the\\nWeasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.\\nDumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when\\nthey had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\\n\\u3000\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do\\nhere! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\\n\\u3000The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering\\ncrowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\'s legs\\nwere like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food.\\nHe was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits\\nalong the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that\\ntwice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels\\nand hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and\\ndragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther\\nthey had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\n\\u3000A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them,\\nand as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing\\nthemselves at him.\\n\\u3000\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He\\nraised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"\\n\\u3000A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\n\\u3000\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\\n\\u3000There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a\\nwide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the\\nwalking sticks.\\n\\u3000\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"\\n\\u3000He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\n\\u3000\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked\\nPercy.\\n\\u3000Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking\\nsticks on Neville\\'s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats\\nof armor as he passed.\\n\\u3000\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again.\\n\"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even\\nlisten to us prefects. Here we are.\"\\n\\u3000At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman\\nin a pink silk dress.\\n\\u3000\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait\\nswung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled\\nthrough it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the\\nGryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy\\narmchairs.\\n\\u3000Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the\\nboys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were\\nobviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five\\nfour-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had\\nalready been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their\\npajamas and fell into bed.\\n\\u3000\" Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.\\n\"Get off, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\"\\n\\u3000Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but\\nhe fell asleep almost at once.\\n\\u3000Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very\\nstrange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\\'s turban, which kept\\ntalking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once,\\nbecause it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\\'t want to be\\nin Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it\\ntightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he\\nstruggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher,\\nSnape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of\\ngreen light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\\n\\u3000He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he\\ndidn\\'t remember the dream at all.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER EIGHT: THE POTIONS MASTER\\n\\u3000There, look.\"\\n\\u3000\"Where?\"\\n\\u3000\"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\"\\n\\u3000\"Wearing the glasses?\"\\n\\u3000\"Did you see his face?\"\\n\\u3000\"Did you see his scar?\"\\n\\u3000Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the\\nnext day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a\\nlook at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again,\\nstaring. Harry wished they wouldn\\'t, because he was trying to\\nconcentrate on finding his way to classes.\\n\\u3000There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere\\ndifferent on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you\\nhad to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\'t open\\nunless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place,\\nand doors that weren\\'t really doors at all, but solid walls just\\npretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was,\\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits\\nkept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor\\ncould walk.\\n\\u3000The ghosts didn\\'t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one\\nof them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.\\nNearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in\\nthe right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked\\ndoors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for\\nclass. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from\\nunder your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you,\\ninvisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"\\n\\u3000Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker,\\nArgus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him\\non their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way\\nthrough a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-\\nof-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\\'t believe they were\\nlost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was\\nthreatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by\\nProfessor Quirrell, who was passing.\\n\\u3000Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored\\ncreature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\'s. She patrolled\\nthe corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of\\nline, and she\\'d whisk off for Filch, who\\'d appear, wheezing, two\\nseconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better\\nthan anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as\\nsuddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was\\nthe dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\\n\\u3000And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the\\nclasses themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly\\nfound out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\n\\u3000They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the\\nmovements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the\\ngreenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little\\nwitch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of\\nall the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used\\nfor.\\n\\u3000Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the\\nonly one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old\\n\\u3000indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and\\ngot up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns\\ndroned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got\\nEmetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\\n\\u3000Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who\\nhad to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of\\ntheir first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\'s\\nname he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite\\nright to think she wasn\\'t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave\\nthem a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\\n\\u3000\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic\\nyou will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my\\nclass will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"\\n\\u3000Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all\\nvery impressed and couldn\\'t wait to get started, but soon realized they\\nweren\\'t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long\\ntime. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a\\nmatch and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the\\nlesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match;\\nProfessor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and\\npointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\n\\u3000The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\'s lessons turned out to be a bit of a\\njoke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said\\nwas to ward off a vampire he\\'d met in Romania and was afraid would\\nbe coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told\\nthem, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for\\ngetting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\\'t sure they\\nbelieved this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked\\neagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went\\npink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had\\nnoticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley\\ntwins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell\\nwas protected wherever he went.\\n\\u3000Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\'t miles behind\\neveryone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like\\nhim, hadn\\'t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There\\nwas so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\\'t have much of a\\nhead start.\\n\\u3000Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally\\nmanaged to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast\\nwithout getting lost once.\\n\\u3000\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on\\nhis porridge.\\n\\u3000\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\'s Head of\\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we\\'ll be able to see\\nif it\\'s true.\"\\n\\u3000\"Wish McGonagall favored us, \" said Harry. Professor McGonagall\\nwas head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\'t stopped her from giving\\nthem a huge pile of homework the day before.\\n\\u3000Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now,\\nbut it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about\\na hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during\\nbreakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and\\ndropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\n\\u3000Hedwig hadn\\'t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew\\nin to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in\\nthe owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she\\nfluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and\\ndropped a note onto Harry\\'s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said,\\nin a very untidy scrawl:\\n\\u3000Dear Harry,\\n\\u3000I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and\\nhave a cup of tea with me around three?\\n\\u3000I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back\\nwith Hedwig.\\n\\u3000Hagrid\\n\\u3000Harry borrowed Ron\\'s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on\\nthe back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\n\\u3000It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to,\\nbecause the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had\\nhappened to him so far.\\n\\u3000At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that\\nProfessor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he\\nknew he\\'d been wrong. Snape didn\\'t dislike Harry -- he hated him.\\n\\u3000Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was\\ncolder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite\\ncreepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all\\naround the walls.\\n\\u3000Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like\\nFlitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name.\\n\\u3000\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"\\n\\u3000Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind\\ntheir hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the\\nclass. His eyes were black like Hagrid\\'s, but they had none of Hagrid\\'s\\nwarmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark\\ntunnels.\\n\\u3000\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of\\npotionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but\\nthey caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y\\ncaught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of\\nkeeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-\\nwaving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t\\nexpect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering\\ncauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that\\ncreep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the\\nsenses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper\\ndeath -- if you aren\\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have\\nto teach.\"\\n\\u3000More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged\\nlooks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her\\nseat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\'t a\\ndunderhead.\\n\\u3000\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added\\npowdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"\\n\\u3000Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at\\nRon, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\\'s hand had shot\\ninto the air.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t know, sit,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000Snape\\'s lips curled into a sneer.\\n\\u3000\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\"\\n\\u3000He ignored Hermione\\'s hand.\\n\\u3000\"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find\\nme a bezoar?\"\\n\\u3000Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go\\nwithout her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\\'t have the faintest idea\\nwhat a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,\\nwho were shaking with laughter.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t know, sit.\" \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before\\ncoming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into\\nthose cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but\\ndid Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand\\nMagical Herbs and Fungi?\\n\\u3000Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand.\\n\\u3000\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and\\nwolfsbane?\"\\n\\u3000At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\nceiling.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though,\\nwhy don\\'t you try her?\"\\n\\u3000A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\'s eye, and Seamus\\nwinked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\\n\\u3000\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter,\\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is\\nknown as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from\\nthe stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for\\nmonkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes\\nby the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\"\\n\\u3000There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the\\nnoise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House\\nfor your cheek, Potter.\"\\n\\u3000Things didn\\'t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\\ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a\\nsimple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,\\nwatching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing\\nalmost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just\\ntelling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his\\nhorned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing\\nfilled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\'s\\ncauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the\\nstone floor, burning holes in people\\'s shoes. Within seconds, the whole\\nclass was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been\\ndrenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain\\nas angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\\n\\u3000\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\\nwave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before\\ntaking the cauldron off the fire?\"\\n\\u3000Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\n\\u3000\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\n\\u3000\"You -- Potter -- why didn\\'t you tell him not to add the quills?\\nThought he\\'d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\'s\\nanother point you\\'ve lost for Gryffindor.\"\\n\\u3000This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron\\nkicked him behind their cauldron.\\n\\u3000\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\'ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"\\n\\u3000As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s\\nmind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for\\nGryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much?\\n\"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape\\'s always taking points off Fred and\\nGeorge. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"\\n\\u3000At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\\ngrounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the\\nforbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the\\nfront door.\\n\\u3000When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside\\nand several booming barks. Then Hagrid\\'s voice rang out, saying,\\n\"Back, Fang -- back.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid\\'s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door\\nopen.\\n\\u3000\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"\\n\\u3000He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an\\nenormous black boarhound.\\n\\u3000There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging\\nfrom the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in\\nthe corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\n\\u3000\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who\\nbounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang\\nwas clearly not as fierce as he looked.\\n\\u3000\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water\\ninto a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\n\\u3000\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. I\\nspent half me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\\n\\u3000The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke\\ntheir teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they\\ntold Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on\\nHarry\\'s knee and drooled all over his robes.\\n\\u3000Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch \"that old\\ngit.\"\\n\\u3000\"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang\\nsometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows\\nme everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\"\\n\\u3000Harry told Hagrid about Snape\\'s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry\\nnot to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\n\\u3000\"But he seemed to really hate me.\"\\n\\u3000\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"\\n\\u3000Yet Harry couldn\\'t help thinking that Hagrid didn\\'t quite meet his\\neyes when he said that.\\n\\u3000\"How\\'s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot --\\ngreat with animals.\"\\n\\u3000Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.\\nWhile Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\\'s work with dragons, Harry\\npicked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea\\ncozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:\\n\\u3000GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\n\\u3000Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,\\nwidely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\n\\u3000Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The\\nvault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\n\\u3000\"But we\\'re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out\\nif you know what\\'s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this\\nafternoon.\\n\\u3000Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had\\ntried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\'t mentioned the date.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my\\nbirthday! It might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\"\\n\\u3000There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\'t meet Harry\\'s\\neyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry\\nread the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been\\nemptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven\\nhundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that\\ngrubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking\\nfor?\\n\\u3000As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\\nweighed down with rock cakes they\\'d been too polite to refuse, Harry\\nthought that none of the lessons he\\'d had so far had given him as\\nmuch to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that\\npackage just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know\\nsomething about Snape that he didn\\'t want to tell Harry?\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER NINE: THE MIDNIGHT DUEL\\n\\u3000Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than\\nDudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.\\n\\u3000Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so\\nthey didn\\'t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\\'t\\nuntil they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room\\nthat made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on\\nThursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\n\\u3000\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a\\nfool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"\\n\\u3000He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything\\nelse.\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron\\nreasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how\\ngood he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"\\n\\u3000Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly\\nabout first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told\\nlong, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly\\nescaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\\'t the only one, though: the\\nway Seamus Finnigan told it, he\\'d spent most of his childhood\\nzooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would\\ntell anyone who\\'d listen about the time he\\'d almost hit a hang glider\\non Charlie\\'s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about\\nQuidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean\\nThomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\'t see\\nwhat was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was\\nallowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\\'s poster of West\\nHam soccer team, trying to make the players move.\\n\\u3000Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\'d\\nhad good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary\\nnumber of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\\n\\u3000Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville\\nwas. This was something you couldn\\'t learn by heart out of a book --\\nnot that she hadn\\'t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all\\nstupid with flying tips she\\'d gotten out of a library book called\\nQuidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every\\nword, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his\\nbroomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when\\nHermione\\'s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\n\\u3000Harry hadn\\'t had a single letter since Hagrid\\'s note, something that\\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\\'s eagle owl was\\nalways bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened\\ngloatingly at the Slytherin table.\\n\\u3000A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother.\\nHe opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large\\nmarble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this\\ntells you if there\\'s something you\\'ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it\\ntight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the\\nRemembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve forgotten something...\"\\n\\u3000Neville was trying to remember what he\\'d forgotten when Draco\\nMalfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the\\nRemembrall out of his hand.\\n\\u3000Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a\\nreason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot\\ntrouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s going on?\"\\n\\u3000\"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\\n\\u3000Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the\\ntable.\\n\\u3000\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle\\nbehind him.\\n\\u3000At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors\\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying\\nlesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their\\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat\\nlawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest,\\nwhose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\n\\u3000The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks\\nlying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George\\nWeasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them\\nstarted to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the\\nleft.\\n\\u3000Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\\n\\u3000\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by\\na broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\\n\\u3000Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs\\nstuck out at odd angles.\\n\\u3000\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch\\nat the front, \"and say \\'Up!\"\\'\\n\\u3000\"UPF everyone shouted.\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the\\nfew that did. Hermione Granger\\'s had simply rolled over on the\\nground, and Neville\\'s hadn\\'t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses,\\ncould tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in\\nNeville\\'s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his\\nfeet on the ground.\\n\\u3000Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms\\nwithout sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows\\ncorrecting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told\\nMalfoy he\\'d been doing it wrong for years.\\n\\u3000\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\"\\nsaid Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and\\nthen come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my\\nwhistle -- three -- two --\"\\n\\u3000But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam\\nHooch\\'s lips.\\n\\u3000\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up\\nlike a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw\\nhis scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him\\ngasp, slip sideways off the broom and --\\n\\u3000WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the\\ngrass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and\\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\n\\u3000Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\n\\u3000\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it\\'s all\\nright, up you get.\".\\n\\u3000She turned to the rest of the class.\\n\\u3000\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!\\nYou leave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts\\nbefore you can say \\'Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\"\\n\\u3000Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\\nMadam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\n\\u3000No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\n\\u3000\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\\n\\u3000The other Slytherins joined in.\\n\\u3000\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\\n\\u3000\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-\\nfaced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you\\'d like fat little crybabies,\\nParvati.\"\\n\\u3000\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of\\nthe grass. \"It\\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\\'s gran sent him.\"\\n\\u3000The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\n\\u3000\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped\\ntalking to watch.\\n\\u3000Malfoy smiled nastily.\\n\\u3000\"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about\\n-- up a tree?\"\\n\\u3000\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his\\nbroomstick and taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, he could fly well.\\nHovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come\\nand get it, Potter!\"\\n\\u3000Harry grabbed his broom.\\n\\u3000\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to\\nmove -- you\\'ll get us all into trouble.\"\\n\\u3000Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the\\nbroom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air\\nrushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and\\nin a rush of fierce joy he realized he\\'d found something he could do\\nwithout being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled\\nhis broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams\\nand gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from\\nRon.\\n\\u3000He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy\\nlooked stunned.\\n\\u3000\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh,\\nyeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\n\\u3000Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped\\nthe broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a\\njavelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a\\nsharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were\\nclapping.\\n\\u3000\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry\\ncalled.\\n\\u3000The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\n\\u3000\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball\\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\n\\u3000Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\\nthen start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle\\ndown -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the\\nball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people\\nwatching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he\\ncaught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently\\nonto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\\n\\u3000\"HARRY POTTER!\"\\n\\u3000His heart sank faster than he\\'d just dived. Professor McGonagall was\\nrunning toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\n\\u3000\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her\\nglasses flashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your\\nneck --\"\\n\\u3000\"It wasn\\'t his fault, Professor --\"\\n\\u3000\"Be quiet, Miss Patil\\n\\u3000\"But Malfoy --\"\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\\n\\u3000Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\'s triumphant faces\\nas he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\'s wake as she\\nstrode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.\\nHe wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be\\nsomething wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping\\nalong without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\'d\\ndone it. He hadn\\'t even lasted two weeks. He\\'d be packing his bags in\\nten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the\\ndoorstep?\\n\\u3000Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\\nMcGonagall didn\\'t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and\\nmarched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.\\nMaybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid,\\nexpelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be\\nHagrid\\'s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching\\nRon and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the\\ngrounds carrying Hagrid\\'s bag.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the\\ndoor and poked her head inside.\\n\\u3000\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a\\nmoment?\"\\n\\u3000Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going\\nto use on him?\\n\\u3000But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who\\ncame out of Flitwicles class looking confused.\\n\\u3000\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched\\non up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\n\\u3000\"In here.\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was\\nempty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the\\nblackboard.\\n\\u3000\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\\nclanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall\\nslammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\n\\u3000\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"\\n\\u3000Wood\\'s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\n\\u3000\"Are you serious, Professor?\"\\n\\u3000\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\'s a\\nnatural. I\\'ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a\\nbroomstick, Potter?\"\\n\\u3000Harry nodded silently. He didn\\'t have a clue what was going on, but\\nhe didn\\'t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started\\ncoming back to his legs.\\n\\u3000\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor\\nMcGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley\\ncouldn\\'t have done it.\"\\n\\u3000Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at\\nonce.\\n\\u3000\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly.\\n\\u3000\"Wood\\'s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall\\nexplained.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking\\naround Harry and staring at him. \"Light -- speedy -- we\\'ll have to get\\nhim a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a\\nCleansweep Seven, I\\'d say.\"\\n\\u3000I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\'t bend the\\nfirst-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.\\nFlattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\'t look Severus Snape\\nin the face for weeks....\"\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\n\\u3000\"I want to hear you\\'re training hard, Potter, or I may change my\\nmind about punishing you.\"\\n\\u3000Then she suddenly smiled.\\n\\u3000\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent\\nQuidditch player himself.\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re joking.\"\\n\\u3000It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had\\nhappened when he\\'d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron\\nhad a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\'d\\nforgotten all about it.\\n\\u3000\"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never -- you must be the youngest\\nhouse player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his\\nmouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the\\nafternoon. \"Wood told me.\"\\n\\u3000Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\n\\u3000\"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\\'t tell anyone,\\nWood wants to keep it a secret.\"\\n\\u3000Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry,\\nand hurried over.\\n\\u3000\"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We\\'re on the\\nteam too -- Beaters.\"\\n\\u3000\"I tell you, we\\'re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\"\\nsaid Fred. \"We haven\\'t won since Charlie left, but this year\\'s team is\\ngoing to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost\\nskipping when he told us.\"\\n\\u3000\"Anyway, we\\'ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\'s found a new\\nsecret passageway out of the school.\"\\n\\u3000\"Bet it\\'s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we\\nfound in our first week. See you.\"\\n\\u3000Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less\\nwelcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\u3000\"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to\\nthe Muggles?\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re a lot braver now that you\\'re back on the ground and you\\'ve\\ngot your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of\\ncourse nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High\\nTable was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack\\ntheir knuckles and scowl.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'d take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you\\nwant. Wizard\\'s duel. Wands only -- no contact. What\\'s the matter?\\nNever heard of a wizard\\'s duel before, I suppose?\"\\n\\u3000\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\\'m his second,\\nwho\\'s yours?\"\\n\\u3000Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\n\\u3000\"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\\'ll meet you in the trophy\\nroom; that\\'s always unlocked.\"\\n\\u3000When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What\\nis a wizard\\'s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\\'re my\\nsecond?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, a second\\'s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually,\\ngetting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\'s\\nface, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you\\nknow, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\'ll be able to do is\\nsend sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do\\nany real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"\\n\\u3000\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"\\n\\u3000\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse\\nme.\"\\n\\u3000They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\n\\u3000\"I couldn\\'t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --\"\\n\\u3000\"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered.\\n\\u3000\"--and you mustn\\'t go wandering around the school at night, think\\nof the points you\\'ll lose Gryffindor if you\\'re caught, and you\\'re bound\\nto be. It\\'s really very selfish of you.\"\\n\\u3000\"And it\\'s really none of your business,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Good-bye,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000All the same, it wasn\\'t what you\\'d call the perfect end to the day,\\nHarry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and\\nSeamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\\'t back from the hospital wing).\\nRon had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to\\ncurse you, you\\'d better dodge it, because I can\\'t remember how to\\nblock them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get\\ncaught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck,\\nbreaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys\\nsneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big\\nchance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\\'t miss it.\\n\\u3000\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\"\\n\\u3000They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept\\nacross the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the\\nGryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the\\nfireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They\\nhad almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the\\nchair nearest them, \"I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\"\\n\\u3000A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink\\nbathrobe and a frown.\\n\\u3000\"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\"\\n\\u3000\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- he\\'s a\\nprefect, he\\'d put a stop to this.\"\\n\\u3000Harry couldn\\'t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\n\\u3000\"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat\\nLady and climbed through the hole.\\n\\u3000Hermione wasn\\'t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron\\nthrough the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about\\nyourselves, I don\\'t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\'ll lose\\nall the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about\\nSwitching Spells.\"\\n\\u3000\"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I\\nsaid when you\\'re on the train home tomorrow, you\\'re so --\"\\n\\u3000But what they were, they didn\\'t find out. Hermione had turned to\\nthe portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing\\nan empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and\\nHermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.\\n\\u3000\"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s your problem,\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to go, we 3 re going to\\nbe late.\"\\n\\u3000They hadn\\'t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione\\ncaught up with them.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m coming with you,\" she said.\\n\\u3000\"You are not.\"\\n\\u3000\"D\\'you think I\\'m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch\\nme? If he finds all three of us I\\'ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to\\nstop you, and you can back me up.\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve got some nerve --\" said Ron loudly.\\n\\u3000\"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. I heard something.\"\\n\\u3000It was a sort of snuffling.\\n\\u3000\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\n\\u3000It wasn\\'t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,\\nfast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\n\\u3000\"Thank goodness you found me! I\\'ve been out here for hours, I\\ncouldn\\'t remember the new password to get in to bed.\"\\n\\u3000\"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\\'s \\'Pig snout\\' but it\\nwon\\'t help you now, the Fat Lady\\'s gone off somewhere.\"\\n\\u3000\"How\\'s your arm?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in\\nabout a minute.\"\\n\\u3000\"Good - well, look, Neville, we\\'ve got to be somewhere, we\\'ll see you\\nlater --\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\'t want\\nto stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\'s been past twice already.\"\\n\\u3000Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\\nNeville.\\n\\u3000\"If either of you get us caught, I\\'ll never rest until I\\'ve learned that\\nCurse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\\n\\u3000Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use\\nthe Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and\\nbeckoned them all forward.\\n\\u3000They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the\\nhigh windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.\\nNorris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor\\nand tiptoed toward the trophy room.\\n\\u3000Malfoy and Crabbe weren\\'t there yet. The crystal trophy cases\\nglimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates,\\nand statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along\\nthe walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.\\nHarry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.\\nThe minutes crept by.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s late, maybe he\\'s chickened out,\" Ron whispered.\\n\\u3000Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just\\nraised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn\\'t\\nMalfoy.\\n\\u3000\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"\\n\\u3000It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved\\nmadly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they\\nscurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\\'s voice. Neville\\'s\\nrobes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch\\nenter the trophy room.\\n\\u3000\"They\\'re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably\\nhiding.\"\\n\\u3000\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began\\nto creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear\\nFilch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and\\nbroke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the\\npair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.\\n\\u3000The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\n\\u3000\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the\\ngallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they\\nswung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then\\nanother, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or\\nwhere they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found\\nthemselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out\\nnear their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the\\ntrophy room.\\n\\u3000\"I think we\\'ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall\\nand wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and\\nspluttering.\\n\\u3000I -- told -you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\\n\"I -- told -- you.\"\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as\\npossible.\"\\n\\u3000\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that,\\ndon\\'t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was\\ngoing to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"\\n\\u3000Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\\'t going to tell\\nher that.\\n\\u3000\"Let\\'s go.\"\\n\\u3000It wasn\\'t going to be that simple. They hadn\\'t gone more than a\\ndozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting\\nout of a classroom in front of them.\\n\\u3000It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\n\\u3000\"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you\\'ll get us thrown out.\"\\n\\u3000Peeves cackled.\\n\\u3000\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut.\\nNaughty, naughty, you\\'ll get caughty.\"\\n\\u3000\"Not if you don\\'t give us away, Peeves, please.\"\\n\\u3000\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his\\neyes glittered wickedly. \"It\\'s for your own good, you know.\"\\n\\u3000\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this\\nwas a big mistake.\\n\\u3000\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF\\nBED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\"\\n\\u3000Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of\\nthe corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.\\n\\u3000\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door,\\n\"We\\'re done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch\\nrunning as fast as he could toward Peeves\\'s shouts.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\'s wand,\\ntapped the lock, and whispered, \\'Alohomora!\"\\n\\u3000The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it,\\nshut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\n\\u3000\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\\n\\u3000\"Say \\'please.\"\\'\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"\\n\\u3000\"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his\\nannoying singsong voice.\\n\\u3000\"All right -please.\"\\n\\u3000\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\'t say nothing if you didn\\'t\\nsay please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves\\nwhooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.\\n\\u3000\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\'ll be\\nokay -- get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of\\nHarry\\'s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\\n\\u3000Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment,\\nhe was sure he\\'d walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top\\nof everything that had happened so far.\\n\\u3000They weren\\'t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a\\ncorridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they\\nknew why it was forbidden.\\n\\u3000They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog\\nthat filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three\\nheads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching\\n\\u3000and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva\\nhanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\n\\u3000It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry\\nknew that the only reason they weren\\'t already dead was that their\\nsudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting\\nover that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls\\nmeant.\\n\\u3000Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he\\'d take\\nFilch.\\n\\u3000They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran,\\nthey almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off\\nto look for them somewhere else, because they didn\\'t see him\\nanywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as\\nmuch space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\\'t\\nstop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the\\nseventh floor.\\n\\u3000\"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their\\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\n\\u3000\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the\\nportrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and\\ncollapsed, trembling, into armchairs.\\n\\u3000It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed,\\nlooked as if he\\'d never speak again.\\n\\u3000\"What do they think they\\'re doing, keeping a thing like that locked\\nup in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one\\ndoes.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.\\n\"You don\\'t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\\'t\\nyou see what it was standing on.\\n\\u3000\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too\\nbusy with its heads.\"\\n\\u3000\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\'s obviously\\nguarding something.\"\\n\\u3000She stood up, glaring at them.\\n\\u3000I hope you\\'re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\\n-- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed.\"\\n\\u3000Ron stared after her, his mouth open.\\n\\u3000\"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said. \"You\\'d think we dragged her along,\\nwouldn\\'t you.\\n\\u3000But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he\\nclimbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had\\nHagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something\\nyou wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.\\n\\u3000It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie\\npackage from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TEN: HALLOWEEN\\n\\u3000Malfoy couldn\\'t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron\\nwere still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly\\ncheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that\\nmeeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and\\nthey were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry\\nfilled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from\\nGringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\\ncould possibly need such heavy protection. \"It\\'s either really valuable\\nor really dangerous,\" said Ron. \"Or both,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it\\nwas about two inches long, they didn\\'t have much chance of guessing\\nwhat it was without further clues.\\n\\u3000Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what\\nlay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was\\nnever going near the dog again.\\n\\u3000Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was\\nsuch a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they\\nreally wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their\\ngreat delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\n\\u3000As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\'s\\nattention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six\\nlarge screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see\\nwhat was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared\\ndown and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the\\nfloor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl\\ndropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\n\\u3000Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\n\\u3000DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\n\\u3000It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\'t want\\neverybody knowing you\\'ve got a broomstick or they\\'ll all want one.\\nOliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven\\no\\'clock for your first training session.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall\\n\\u3000Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to\\nread.\\n\\u3000\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\\'ve never even\\ntouched one.\"\\n\\u3000They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in\\nprivate before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall\\nthey found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy\\nseized the package from Harry and felt it.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a\\nmixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\'ll be in for it this time,\\nPotter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\"\\n\\u3000Ron couldn\\'t resist it.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand.\\nWhat did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\"\\nRon grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same\\nleague as the Nimbus.\"\\n\\u3000\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half\\nthe handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers\\nhave to save up twig by twig.\"\\n\\u3000Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\'s\\nelbow.\\n\\u3000\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\\n\\u3000\"Potter\\'s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\\n\\u3000\"Yes, yes, that\\'s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\\n\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,\\nPotter. And what model is it?\"\\n\\u3000\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at\\nthe look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy\\nhere that I\\'ve got it,\" he added.\\n\\u3000Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at\\nMalfoy\\'s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled\\nas they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen\\nNeville\\'s Remembrall I wouln\\'t be on the team....\"\\n\\u3000\"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an\\nangry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the\\nstairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\'s hand.\\n\\u3000\"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\n\\u3000Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.\\nIt kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was\\nlying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d\\nbe learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening\\nwithout noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with\\nRon to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\n\\u3000\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s\\nbedspread.\\n\\u3000Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought\\nit looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had\\na long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written\\nin gold near the top.\\n\\u3000As seven o\\'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\\ndusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium\\nbefore. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so\\nthat the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At\\neither end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.\\nThey reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle\\n\\u3000children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\n\\u3000Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his\\nbroomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he\\nswooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the\\nfield. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his\\nlightest touch.\\n\\u3000\"Hey, Potter, come down!\\'\\n\\u3000Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate\\nunder his arm. Harry landed next to him.\\n\\u3000\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\\nmeant... you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rules\\nthis evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\\n\\u3000He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\n\\u3000\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand,\\neven if it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.\\nThree of them are called Chasers.\"\\n\\u3000\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\\n\\u3000\"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to\\nscore a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of\\nthe hoops. Follow me?\"\\n\\u3000\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to\\nscore,\" Harry recited. \"So -- that\\'s sort of like basketball on\\nbroomsticks with six hoops, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry\\nquickly.\\n\\u3000\"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper -\\nI\\'m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the\\nother team from scoring.\"\\n\\u3000\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to\\nremember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So\\nwhat are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\\n\\u3000He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These\\ntwo are the Bludgers.\"\\n\\u3000He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller\\nthan the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.\\n\\u3000\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of\\nthe Bludgers.\\n\\u3000At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight\\nat Harry\\'s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking\\nhis nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around\\ntheir heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and\\nmanaged to pin it to the ground.\\n\\u3000\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the\\ncrate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around,\\ntrying to knock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two\\nBeaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it\\'s their job to\\nprotect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward\\nthe other team. So -- think you\\'ve got all that?\"\\n\\u3000\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\"\\nHarry reeled off.\\n\\u3000\"Very good,\" said Wood.\\n\\u3000\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he\\nsounded offhand.\\n\\u3000\"Never at Hogwarts. We\\'ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\\nworse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the\\n\\u3000Seeker. That\\'s you. And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle\\nor the Bludgers unless they crack my head open.\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers\\n-- I mean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\\n\\u3000Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the\\nsize of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\\nwings.\\n\\u3000\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important\\nball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and difficult\\nto see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weave in and out\\nof the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other\\nteam\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his\\nteam an extra hundred and fifty points, so they\\n\\u3000nearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game\\nof Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for\\nages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing\\non substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\'s it --\\nany questions?\"\\n\\u3000Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it\\nwas doing it that was going to be the problem.\\n\\u3000\"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully\\nshutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s\\ntry you out with a few of these.\"\\n\\u3000He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the\\ngolf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half\\nan hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\'t carry on.\\n\\u3000\"That Quidditch cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood\\nhappily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised\\nif you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played\\nfor England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\"\\n\\u3000Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch\\npractice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry\\ncould hardly believe it when he realized that he\\'d already been at\\nHogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet\\nDrive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more\\ninteresting now that they had mastered the basics.\\n\\u3000On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\\npumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor\\nFlitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to\\nstart making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try\\nsince they\\'d seen him make Neville\\'s toad zoom around the classroom.\\nProfessor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\\'s partner\\nwas Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been\\ntrying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\\nHermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was\\nangrier about this. She hadn\\'t spoken to either of them since the day\\nHarry\\'s broomstick had arrived.\\n\\u3000\"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\"\\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as\\nusual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the\\nmagic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard\\nBaruffio, who said \\'s\\' instead of \\'f\\' and found himself on the floor with\\na buffalo on his chest.\"\\n\\u3000It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the\\ndesktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand\\nand set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.\\n\\u3000Ron, at the next table, wasn\\'t having much more luck.\\n\\u3000\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a\\nwindmill.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\'s Wing-gar-\\ndium Levi-o-sa, make the \\'gar\\' nice and long.\"\\n\\u3000\"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled.\\n\\u3000Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and\\nsaid, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\\n\\u3000Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above\\ntheir heads.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see\\nhere, Miss Granger\\'s done it!\"\\n\\u3000Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It\\'s no wonder\\nno one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into\\nthe crowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly. \"\\n\\u3000Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was\\nHermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to\\nsee that she was in tears.\\n\\u3000\"I think she heard you.\"\\n\\u3000\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve\\nnoticed she\\'s got no friends.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione didn\\'t turn up for the next class and wasn\\'t seen all\\nafternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween\\nfeast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend\\nLavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\\' bathroom and wanted\\nto be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment\\nlater they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween\\ndecorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\n\\u3000A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a\\nthousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making\\nthe candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on\\nthe golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\\n\\u3000Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor\\nQuirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on\\nhis face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair,\\nslumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons --\\nthought you ought to know.\"\\n\\u3000He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\n\\u3000There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding\\nfrom the end of Professor Dumbledore\\'s wand to bring silence.\\n\\u3000\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories\\nimmediately!\"\\n\\u3000Percy was in his element.\\n\\u3000\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if\\nyou follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first\\nyears coming through! Excuse me, I\\'m a prefect!\"\\n\\u3000\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron.\\n\"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\\n\\u3000They passed different groups of people hurrying in different\\ndirections. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused\\nHufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\\'s arm.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve just thought -- Hermione.\"\\n\\u3000\"What about her?\"\\n\\u3000\"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\"\\n\\u3000Ron bit his lip.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\\'d better not see us.\"\\n\\u3000Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way,\\nslipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the\\ngirls\\' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard\\nquick footsteps behind them.\\n\\u3000\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\n\\u3000Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He\\ncrossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the\\ndungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"\\n\\u3000\"Search me.\"\\n\\u3000Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\'s\\nfading footsteps.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his\\nhand.\\n\\u3000\"Can you smell something?\"\\n\\u3000Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\n\\u3000And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls\\nof gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,\\nsomething huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the\\nshadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\\n\\u3000It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite\\ngray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head\\nperched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks\\nwith flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was\\nholding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because\\nits arms were so long.\\n\\u3000The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled\\nits long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the\\nroom.\\n\\u3000\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"\\n\\u3000\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.\\n\\u3000They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll\\nwasn\\'t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to\\ngrab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\\n\\u3000\\'Yes!\"\\n\\u3000Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage,\\nbut as they reached the corner they heard something that made their\\nhearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the\\nchamber they\\'d just chained up.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\\n\\u3000\"Hermione!\" they said together.\\n\\u3000It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they\\nhave? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the\\nkey, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran\\ninside.\\n\\u3000Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking\\nas if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking\\nthe sinks off the walls as it went.\\n\\u3000\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he\\nthrew it as hard as he could against the wall.\\n\\u3000The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around,\\nblinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes\\nsaw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it\\nwent.\\n\\u3000\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and\\nhe threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\'t even seem to notice the\\npipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again,\\nturning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run\\naround it.\\n\\u3000\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her\\ntoward the door, but she couldn\\'t move, she was still flat against the\\nwall, her mouth open with terror.\\n\\u3000The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.\\nIt roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no\\nway to escape.\\n\\u3000Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid:\\nHe took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around\\nthe troll\\'s neck from behind. The troll couldn\\'t feel Harry hanging\\nthere, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its\\nnose, and Harry\\'s wand had still been in his hand when he\\'d jumped --\\nit had gone straight up one of the troll\\'s nostrils.\\n\\u3000Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\\nclinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off\\nor catch him a terrible blow with the club.\\n\\u3000Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own\\nwand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry\\nthe first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\\n\\u3000The club flew suddenly out of the troll\\'s hand, rose high, high up\\ninto the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack,\\nonto its owner\\'s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat\\non its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\\n\\u3000Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\\nstanding there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\n\\u3000It was Hermione who spoke first.\\n\\u3000\"Is it -- dead?\"\\n\\u3000I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\"\\n\\u3000He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\'s nose. It was\\ncovered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\n\\u3000\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"\\n\\u3000He wiped it on the troll\\'s trousers.\\n\\u3000A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look\\nup. They hadn\\'t realized what a racket they had been making, but of\\ncourse, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the\\ntroll\\'s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting\\ninto the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up\\nthe rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper,\\nand sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\n\\u3000Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron\\nand Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were\\nwhite. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from\\nHarry\\'s mind.\\n\\u3000\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall,\\nwith cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still\\nstanding with his wand in the air. \"You\\'re lucky you weren\\'t killed.\\nWhy aren\\'t you in your dormitory?\"\\n\\u3000Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor.\\nHe wished Ron would put his wand down.\\n\\u3000Then a small voice came out of the shadows.\\n\\u3000\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"\\n\\u3000\"Miss Granger!\"\\n\\u3000Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\n\\u3000I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it\\non my own -- you know, because I\\'ve read all about them.\"\\n\\u3000Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie\\nto a teacher? \"If they hadn\\'t found me, I\\'d be dead now. Harry stuck\\nhis wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They\\ndidn\\'t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me\\noff when they arrived.\"\\n\\u3000Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\'t new to\\nthem.\\n\\u3000\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the\\nthree of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of\\ntackling a mountain troll on your own?\"\\n\\u3000Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the\\nlast person to do anything against the rules, and here she was,\\npretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had\\nstarted handing out sweets.\\n\\u3000\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\"\\nsaid Professor McGonagall. \"I\\'m very disappointed in you. If you\\'re not\\nhurt at all, you\\'d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are\\nfinishing the feast in their houses.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione left.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\\ntaken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five\\npoints. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\\n\\u3000They hurried out of the chamber and didn\\'t speak at all until they\\nhad climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of\\nthe troll, quite apart from anything else.\\n\\u3000\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled.\\n\\u3000\"Five, you mean, once she\\'s taken off Hermione\\'s.\"\\n\\u3000\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind\\nyou, we did save her.\"\\n\\u3000\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\\'t locked the thing in\\nwith her,\" Harry reminded him.\\n\\u3000They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\n\\u3000\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\\n\\u3000The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the\\nfood that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the\\ndoor, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then,\\nnone of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and\\nhurried off to get plates.\\n\\u3000But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend.\\nThere are some things you can\\'t share without ending up liking each\\nother, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER ELEVEN: QUIDDITCH\\n\\u3000As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The\\nmountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled\\nsteel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be\\nseen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the\\nQuidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur\\ngloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\n\\u3000The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be\\nplaying in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus\\nSlytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in\\nthe house championship.\\n\\u3000Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that,\\nas their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the\\nnews that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry\\ndidn\\'t know which was worse -- people telling him he\\'d be brilliant or\\npeople telling him they\\'d be running around underneath him holding a\\nmattress.\\n\\u3000It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He\\ndidn\\'t know how he\\'d have gotten through all his homework without\\nher, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was\\nmaking them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages,\\nwhich turned out to be a very interesting read.\\n\\u3000Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup\\nmatch in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest\\nplayers, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen\\nto them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees\\nhad been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara\\nDesert.\\n\\u3000Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since\\nHarry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was\\nmuch nicer for it. The day before Harry\\'s first Quidditch match the\\nthree of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she\\nhad conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around\\nin a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm,\\nwhen Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was\\nlimping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block\\nthe fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\'t be allowed.\\nUnfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\\'s eye.\\nHe limped over. He hadn\\'t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking\\nfor a reason to tell them off anyway.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\"\\n\\u3000It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\n\\u3000\"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape.\\n\"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\"\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape\\nlimped away. \"Wonder what\\'s wrong with his leg?\"\\n\\u3000\"Dunno, but I hope it\\'s really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly.\\n\\u3000The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was\\nchecking Harry and Ron\\'s Charms homework for them. She would\\nnever let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read\\nit through, they got the right answers anyway.\\n\\u3000Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to\\ntake his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid\\nof Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask\\nSnape if he could have it.\\n\\u3000\"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that\\nSnape wouldn\\'t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\n\\u3000He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no\\nanswer. He knocked again. Nothing.\\n\\u3000Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He\\npushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his\\neyes.\\n\\u3000Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes\\nabove his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was\\nhanding Snape bandages.\\n\\u3000\"Blasted thing*,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep\\nyour eyes on all three heads at once?\"\\n\\u3000Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --\\n\\u3000\"POTTER!\"\\n\\u3000Snape\\'s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly\\nto hide his leg. Harry gulped.\\n\\u3000\"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\"\\n\\u3000\"GET OUT! OUT!\"\\n\\u3000Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from\\nGryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.\\n\\u3000\"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What\\'s the\\nmatter?\"\\n\\u3000In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\'d seen.\\n\\u3000\"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to\\nget past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\\'s where he was\\ngoing when we saw him -- he\\'s after whatever it\\'s guarding! And Id bet\\nmy broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\"\\n\\u3000Hermione\\'s eyes were wide.\\n\\u3000\"No -- he wouldn\\'t, she said. \"I know he\\'s not very nice, but he\\nwouldn\\'t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\"\\n\\u3000\"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or\\nsomething,\" snapped Ron. \"I\\'m with Harry. I wouldn\\'t put anything\\npast Snape. But what\\'s he after? What\\'s that dog guarding?\"\\n\\u3000Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question.\\nNeville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t sleep. He tried to empty\\nhis mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch\\nmatch in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape\\'s face when Harry\\nhad seen his leg wasn\\'t easy to forget.\\n\\u3000The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was\\nfull of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of\\neveryone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve got to eat some breakfast.\"\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t want anything.\"\\n\\u3000\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not hungry.\"\\n\\u3000Harry felt terrible. In an hour\\'s time he\\'d be walking onto the field.\\n\\u3000\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are\\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\"\\n\\u3000\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\\nsausages.\\n\\u3000By eleven o\\'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands\\naround the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats\\nmight be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what\\nwas going on sometimes.\\n\\u3000Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham\\nfan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a\\nlarge banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter\\nfor President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large\\nGryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky\\nlittle charm so that the paint flashed different colors.\\n\\u3000Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be\\nplaying in green).\\n\\u3000Wood cleared his throat for silence.\\n\\u3000\"Okay, men,\" he said.\\n\\u3000\"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\n\\u3000\"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\"\\n\\u3000\"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley.\\n\\u3000\"The one we\\'ve all been waiting for,\" said George.\\n\\u3000\"We know Oliver\\'s speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on\\nthe team last year.\"\\n\\u3000\"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor\\'s\\nhad in years. We\\'re going to win. I know it.\"\\n\\u3000He glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\"\\n\\u3000\"Right. It\\'s time. Good luck, all of you.\"\\n\\u3000Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping\\nhis knees weren\\'t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud\\ncheers.\\n\\u3000Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field\\nwaiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\n\\u3000\"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were\\nall gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking\\nparticularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry\\nthought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the\\ncorner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing\\nPotter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.\\n\\u3000\"Mount your brooms, please.\"\\n\\u3000Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\n\\u3000Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\n\\u3000Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \"And\\nthe Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor --\\nwhat an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --\"\\n\\u3000\"JORDAN!\"\\n\\u3000\"Sorry, Professor.\"\\n\\u3000The Weasley twins\\' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary\\nfor the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\n\\u3000\"And she\\'s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia\\nSpinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\\'s, last year only a reserve -- back\\nto Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin\\nCaptain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying\\nlike an eagle up there -- he\\'s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent\\nmove by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle\\n-- that\\'s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint,\\noff up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of\\nthe head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that\\'s\\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\'s blocked by a\\nsecond Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\'t tell\\nwhich -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson\\nback in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes\\n-- she\\'s really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are\\nahead -- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses --\\nGRYFFINDORS SCORE!\"\\n\\u3000Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the\\nSlytherins.\\n\\u3000\"Budge up there, move along.\"\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid!\"\\n\\u3000Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space\\nto join them.\\n\\u3000\"Bin watchin\\' from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of\\nbinoculars around his neck, \"But it isn\\'t the same as bein\\' in the crowd.\\nNo sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\"\\n\\u3000\"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn\\'t had much to do yet.\"\\n\\u3000\"Kept outta trouble, though, that\\'s somethin\\',\" said Hagrid, raising\\nhis binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\\n\\u3000Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting\\nabout for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\\'s\\ngame plan.\\n\\u3000\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had\\nsaid. \"We don\\'t want you attacked before you have to be.\"\\n\\u3000When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-\\nloops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the\\nSnitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a\\nreflection from one of the Weasleys\\' wristwatches, and once a Bludger\\ndecided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than\\nanything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.\\n\\u3000\"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\\n\\u3000\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey\\nducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds\\ntoward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\"\\n\\u3000A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the\\nQuaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that\\nhad passed his left ear.\\n\\u3000Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after\\nthe streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too.\\nNeck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed\\nto have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung\\nin midair to watch.\\n\\u3000Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball,\\nwings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed\\n--\\n\\u3000WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus\\nFlint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\'s broom spun off\\ncourse, Harry holding on for dear life.\\n\\u3000\"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors.\\n\\u3000Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at\\nthe goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the\\nGolden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.\\n\\u3000Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref!\\nRed card!\"\\n\\u3000\"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red\\ncard and you\\'re out of the game!\"\\n\\u3000\"But this isn\\'t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.\\n\\u3000Hagrid, however, was on Dean\\'s side.\\n\\u3000\"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the\\nair.\"\\n\\u3000Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\n\\u3000\"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating\\n\\u3000\"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall.\\n\\u3000\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul\\n\\u3000\\'Jordan, I\\'m warning you --\"\\n\\u3000\"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which\\ncould happen to anyone, I\\'m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by\\nSpinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play,\\nGryffindor still in possession.\"\\n\\u3000It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning\\ndangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden,\\nfrightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall.\\nHe gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\'d\\nnever felt anything like that.\\n\\u3000It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck\\nhim off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck\\ntheir riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-\\nposts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he\\nrealized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\\'t\\nturn it. He couldn\\'t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air,\\nand every now and then making violent swishing movements that\\nalmost unseated him.\\n\\u3000Lee was still commentating.\\n\\u3000\"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --\\npasses Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose\\n-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...\\n\\u3000The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that\\nHarry\\'s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly\\nhigher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\n\\u3000\"Dunno what Harry thinks he\\'s doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared\\nthrough his binoculars. \"If I didn\\' know better, I\\'d say he\\'d lost control\\nof his broom... but he can\\'t have....\"\\n\\u3000Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing\\nto hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\'s broom had given a\\nwild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it,\\nholding on with only one hand.\\n\\u3000\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus\\nwhispered.\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can\\'t nothing interfere\\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that\\nto a Nimbus Two Thousand.\"\\n\\u3000At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\'s binoculars, but instead of\\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\n\\u3000\"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\n\\u3000\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape -- look.\"\\n\\u3000Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands\\nopposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering\\nnonstop under his breath.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s doing something -- jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"What should we do?\"\\n\\u3000\"Leave it to me.\"\\n\\u3000Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.\\nRon turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so\\nhard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The\\nwhole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew\\nup to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no\\ngood -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher\\nstill. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping\\nto catch him if he fell. Marcus\\n\\u3000Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone\\nnoticing.\\n\\u3000\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately.\\n\\u3000Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape\\nstood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\'t even\\nstop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the\\nrow in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her\\nwand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames\\nshot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\\'s robes.\\n\\u3000It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on\\nfire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off\\nhim into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --\\nSnape would never know what had happened.\\n\\u3000It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber\\nback on to his broom.\\n\\u3000\"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\\nHagrid\\'s jacket for the last five minutes.\\n\\u3000Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him\\nclap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit\\nthe field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his\\nhand.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the\\ngame ended in complete confusion.\\n\\u3000\"He didn\\'t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling\\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn\\'t broken\\nany rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --\\nGryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry\\nheard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea\\nback in Hagrid\\'s hut, with Ron and Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He\\nwas cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\'t take his eyes off\\nyou.\"\\n\\u3000\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn\\'t heard a word of what had gone\\non next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin\\' like\\nthat?\"\\n\\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what\\nto tell him. Harry decided on the truth.\\n\\u3000\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get\\npast that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was\\ntrying to steal whatever it\\'s guarding.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid dropped the teapot.\\n\\u3000\"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said.\\n\\u3000\"Fluffy?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah -- he\\'s mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the\\npub las\\' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the\\n\\u3000\"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly.\\n\\u3000\"Now, don\\'t ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That\\'s top secret,\\nthat is.\"\\n\\u3000\"But Snape\\'s trying to steal it.\"\\n\\u3000\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape\\'s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\'d do\\nnothin\\' of the sort.\"\\n\\u3000\"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione.\\n\\u3000The afternoon\\'s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind\\nabout Snape.\\n\\u3000I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\'ve read all about them!\\n\\u3000You\\'ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\'t blinking at all, I\\nsaw him!\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m tellin\\' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don\\' know why\\nHarry\\'s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\' try an\\' kill a student!\\nNow, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin\\' in things that don\\'\\nconcern yeh. It\\'s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\\' you forget what\\nit\\'s guardin\\', that\\'s between Professor Dumbledore an\\' Nicolas Flamel\\n--\"\\n\\u3000\"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there\\'s someone called Nicolas Flamel\\ninvolved, is there?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid looked furious with himself.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER TWELVE: THE MIRROR OF\\nERISED\\n\\u3000Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts\\nwoke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid\\nand the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several\\nsnowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back\\nof his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through\\nthe stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by\\nHagrid before they could fly off again.\\n\\u3000No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor\\ncommon room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty\\ncorridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the\\nclassrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\\'s classes down in the\\ndungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept\\nas close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\n\\u3000\"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all\\nthose people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because\\nthey\\'re not wanted at home.\"\\n\\u3000He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle\\nchuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish,\\nignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since\\nthe Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had\\ntried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would\\nbe replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\\'d realized that nobody\\nfound this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry\\nhad managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous\\nand angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper\\nfamily.\\n\\u3000It was true that Harry wasn\\'t going back to Privet Drive for\\nChristmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before,\\nmaking a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and\\nHarry had signed up at once. He didn\\'t feel sorry for himself at all; this\\nwould probably be the best Christmas he\\'d ever had. Ron and his\\nbrothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going\\nto Romania to visit Charlie.\\n\\u3000When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a\\nlarge fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking\\nout at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was\\nbehind it.\\n\\u3000\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through\\nthe branches.\\n\\u3000\"Nah, I\\'m all right, thanks, Ron.\"\\n\\u3000\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoys cold drawl\\nfrom behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money,\\nWeasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave\\nHogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid\\'s must seem like a palace\\ncompared to what your family\\'s used to.\"\\n\\u3000Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\n\\u3000\"WEASLEY!\"\\n\\u3000Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\\'s robes.\\n\\u3000\"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge\\nhairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin\\' his family.\"\\n\\u3000\"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said\\nSnape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it\\nisn\\'t more. Move along, all of you.\"\\n\\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering\\nneedles everywhere and smirking.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\'s back, \"one of\\nthese days, I\\'ll get him --\"\\n\\u3000\"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\"\\n\\u3000\"Come on, cheer up, it\\'s nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh\\nwhat, come with me an\\' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\"\\n\\u3000So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great\\nHall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy\\nwith the Christmas decorations.\\n\\u3000\"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?\"\\n\\u3000The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung\\nall around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees\\nstood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some\\nglittering with hundreds of candles.\\n\\u3000\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked.\\n\\u3000\"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we\\'ve\\ngot half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh yeah, you\\'re right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from\\nProfessor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his\\nwand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.\\n\\u3000\"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just\\nbefore the holidays? Bit keen, aren\\'t yeh?\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, we\\'re not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you\\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\'ve been trying to find out who he is.\"\\n\\u3000\"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here -- I\\'ve told yeh --\\ndrop it. It\\'s nothin\\' to you what that dog\\'s guardin\\'.\"\\n\\u3000\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\'s all,\" said\\nHermione.\\n\\u3000\"Unless you\\'d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added.\\n\"We must\\'ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\'t\\nfind him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I\\'ve read his name\\nsomewhere.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m sayin\\' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.\\n\\u3000\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left\\nHagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\n\\u3000They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\'s name ever since\\nHagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out\\nwhat Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to\\nknow where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to\\nget himself into a book. He wasn\\'t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth\\nCentury, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too,\\nfrom Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent\\nDevelopments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer\\nsize of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves;\\nhundreds of narrow rows.\\n\\u3000Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to\\nsearch while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling\\nthem off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted\\nSection. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\'t\\nsomewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed\\nnote from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books,\\nand he knew he\\'d never get one. These were the books containing\\npowerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by\\nolder students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\n\\u3000\"What are you looking for, boy?\"\\n\\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'d better get out, then. Go on -- out!\"\\n\\u3000Wishing he\\'d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry\\nleft the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\'d\\nbetter not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were\\nsure she\\'d be able to tell them, but they couldn\\'t risk Snape hearing\\nwhat they were up to.\\n\\u3000Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had\\nfound anything, but he wasn\\'t very hopeful. They had been looking for\\ntwo weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between\\nlessons it wasn\\'t surprising they\\'d found nothing. What they really\\nneeded was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down\\ntheir necks.\\n\\u3000Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their\\nheads. They went off to lunch.\\n\\u3000\"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione.\\n\"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"\\n\\u3000\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said\\nRon. \"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\"\\n\\u3000\"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione.\\n\\u3000Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good\\na time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to\\nthemselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they\\nwere able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour\\neating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English\\nmuffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy\\nexpelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\\'t work.\\n\\u3000Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot\\nlike directing troops in battle. Ron\\'s set was very old and battered.\\nLike everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else\\nin his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen\\nweren\\'t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had\\ntrouble getting them to do what he wanted.\\n\\u3000Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and\\nthey didn\\'t trust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they\\nkept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.\\n\"Don\\'t send me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Send him, we can\\nafford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking\\nforward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting\\nany presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the\\nfirst thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.\\n\\u3000\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed\\nand pulled on his bathrobe.\\n\\u3000\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some\\npresents!\"\\n\\u3000\"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile,\\nwhich was a lot bigger than Harry\\'s.\\n\\u3000Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown\\npaper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a\\nroughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself.\\nHarry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.\\n\\u3000A second, very small parcel contained a note.\\n\\u3000We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.\\nFrom Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-\\npence piece.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s friendly,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\n\\u3000\"Weird!\" he said, \\'NMat a shape! This is money?\"\\n\\u3000\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.\\n\"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"\\n\\u3000\"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink\\nand pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t\\nexpect any presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a\\nWeasley sweater.\"\\n\\u3000Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater\\nin emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\n\\u3000\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own,\\n\"and mine\\'s always maroon.\"\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was\\nvery tasty.\\n\\u3000His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate\\nFrogs from Hermione.\\n\\u3000This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very\\nlight. He unwrapped it.\\n\\u3000Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where\\nit lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\\nEvery Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think\\nit is -- they\\'re really rare, and really valuable.\"\\n\\u3000\"What is it?\"\\n\\u3000Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange\\nto the touch, like water woven into material.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m\\nsure it is -- try it on.\"\\n\\u3000Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\n\\u3000\"It is! Look down!\"\\n\\u3000Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\\nmirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head\\nsuspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the\\ncloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\"\\n\\u3000Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,\\nloopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:\\nYour father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was\\nreturned to you. Use it well.\\n\\u3000A Very Merry Christmas to you.\\n\\u3000There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring\\nthe cloak.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'d give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What\\'s the\\nmatter?\"\\n\\u3000\"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak?\\nHad it really once belonged to his father?\\n\\u3000Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was\\nflung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed\\nthe cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with\\nanyone else yet.\\n\\u3000\"Merry Christmas!\"\\n\\u3000\"Hey, look -- Harry\\'s got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\\n\\u3000Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large\\nyellow F on it, the other a G.\\n\\u3000\"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s\\nsweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why aren\\'t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on,\\nget it on, they\\'re lovely and warm.\"\\n\\u3000\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his\\nhead.\\n\\u3000\"You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she\\nthinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid -- we know\\nwe\\'re called Gred and Forge.\"\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s all th is noise.\\n\\u3000Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking\\ndisapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his\\npresents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which\\n\\u3000Fred seized.\\n\\u3000\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\'re all wearing ours,\\neven Harry got one.\"\\n\\u3000\"I -- don\\'t -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater\\nover his head, knocking his glasses askew.\\n\\u3000\"And you\\'re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said\\n\\u3000George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\"\\n\\u3000They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side\\nby his sweater.\\n\\u3000Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A\\nhundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes;\\nplatters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick,\\nrich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every\\nfew feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like\\nthe feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little\\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard\\ncracker with Fred and it didn\\'t just bang, it went off with a blast like a\\ncannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from\\nthe inside exploded a rear admiral\\'s hat and several live, white mice.\\nUp at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\'s\\nhat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke\\nProfessor Flitwick had just read him.\\n\\u3000Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly\\nbroke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched\\nHagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more\\nwine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to\\nHarry\\'s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.\\n\\u3000When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable,\\nluminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new\\nwizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a\\nnasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\\'s Christmas\\ndinner.\\n\\u3000Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\\nsnowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for\\nbreath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room,\\nwhere Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.\\nHe suspected he wouldn\\'t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\\'t tried to\\nhelp him so much.\\n\\u3000After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas\\ncake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except\\nsit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower\\nbecause they\\'d stolen his prefect badge.\\n\\u3000It had been Harry\\'s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had\\nbeen nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed\\ninto bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and\\nwhoever had sent it.\\n\\u3000Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother\\nhim, fell asleep almost as soon as he\\'d drawn the curtains of his four-\\nposter. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak\\nout from under it.\\n\\u3000His father\\'s... this had been his father\\'s. He let the material flow\\nover his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note\\nhad said.\\n\\u3000He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\\naround himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and\\nshadows. It was a very funny feeling.\\n\\u3000Use it well.\\n\\u3000Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open\\nto him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there\\nin the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and\\nFilch would never know.\\n\\u3000Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held\\nhim back -- his father\\'s cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time --\\nhe wanted to use it alone.\\n\\u3000He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common\\nroom, and climbed through the portrait hole.\\n\\u3000\"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He\\nwalked quickly down the corridor.\\n\\u3000Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And\\nthen it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\\'d be able\\nto read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel\\nwas. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he\\nwalked.\\n\\u3000The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see\\nhis way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating\\nalong in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting\\nit, the sight gave him the creeps.\\n\\u3000The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping\\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\\nlibrary, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\\n\\u3000They didn\\'t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\\nwords in languages Harry couldn\\'t understand. Some had no title at\\nall. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.\\nThe hairs on the back of Harry\\'s neck prickled. Maybe he was\\nimagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was\\ncoming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who\\nshouldn\\'t be.\\n\\u3000He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the\\nfloor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book.\\nA large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with\\ndifficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let\\nit fall open.\\n\\u3000A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was\\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one\\nhigh, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked\\nover his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps\\ncoming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back\\non the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\\'s pale,\\nwild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\\'s\\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\\'s shrieks\\nstill ringing in his ears.\\n\\u3000He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had\\nbeen so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\\'t paid attention to\\nwhere he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\'t recognize\\nwhere he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he\\nknew, but he must be five floors above there.\\n\\u3000\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\\nwandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library\\nRestricted Section.\"\\n\\u3000Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch\\nmust know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting\\nnearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted\\nSection? Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\"\\n\\u3000Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the\\ncorner ahead. They couldn\\'t see him, of course, but it was a narrow\\ncorridor and if they came much nearer they\\'d knock right into him --\\nthe cloak didn\\'t stop him from being solid.\\n\\u3000He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left.\\nIt was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath,\\ntrying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the\\nroom without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and\\nHarry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their\\nfootsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few\\nseconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.\\n\\u3000It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and\\nchairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned\\nwastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was\\nsomething that didn\\'t look as if it belonged there, something that\\nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.\\n\\u3000It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate\\ngold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription\\ncarved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.\\nHis panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape,\\nHarry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see\\nno reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\\n\\u3000He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from\\nscreaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more\\nfuriously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not\\nonly himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right\\nbehind him.\\n\\u3000But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back\\nto the mirror.\\n\\u3000There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his\\nshoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too?\\nWas he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\\'s trick\\nwas that it reflected them, invisible or not?\\n\\u3000He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and\\nfelt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\\'d touch her, their\\nreflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the\\nothers existed only in the mirror.\\n\\u3000She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes --\\nher eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the\\nglass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that\\nshe was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,\\nblack-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He\\nwore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just\\nas Harry\\'s did.\\n\\u3000Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly\\ntouching that of his reflection.\\n\\u3000\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"\\n\\u3000They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the\\nfaces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green\\neyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as\\nthough he had Harry\\'s knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his\\nfamily, for the first time in his life.\\n\\u3000The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back\\nat them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was\\nhoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind\\nof ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.\\n\\u3000How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not\\nfade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back\\nto his senses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to\\nbed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll\\ncome back,\" and hurried from the room.\\n\\u3000\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.\\n\\u3000\"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the\\nmirror.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.\\n\\u3000\"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to\\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.\"\\n\\u3000\"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my\\nhouse this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame\\nabout not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something,\\nwhy aren\\'t you eating anything?\"\\n\\u3000Harry couldn\\'t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing\\nthem again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\'t\\nseem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog\\nwas guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\n\\u3000\"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\"\\n\\u3000What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the\\nmirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to\\nwalk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\'s\\nroute from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for\\nnearly an hour.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\"\\n\\u3000\"No!\" Harry hissed. I know it\\'s here somewhere.\"\\n\\u3000They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite\\ndirection, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his\\nfeet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s here -- just here -- yes!\"\\n\\u3000They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around\\nhis shoulders and ran to the mirror.\\n\\u3000There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\\n\\u3000\"See?\" Harry whispered.\\n\\u3000\"I can\\'t see anything.\"\\n\\u3000\"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them....\"\\n\\u3000\"I can only see you.\"\\n\\u3000\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"\\n\\u3000Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\'t\\nsee his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\n\\u3000Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\n\\u3000\"Look at me!\" he said.\\n\\u3000\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"\\n\\u3000\"No -- I\\'m alone -- but I\\'m different -- I look older -- and I\\'m head\\nboy!\"\\n\\u3000\"What?\"\\n\\u3000\"I am -- I\\'m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I\\'m holding\\nthe house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I\\'m Quidditch captain, too.\\n\\u3000Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\\nHarry.\\n\\u3000\"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\"\\n\\u3000\"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --\"\\n\\u3000\"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about\\nthat? I want to see my parents.\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t push me --\"\\n\\u3000A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their\\ndiscussion. They hadn\\'t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\n\\u3000\"Quick!\"\\n\\u3000Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs.\\nNorris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both\\nthinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what\\nseemed an age, she turned and left.\\n\\u3000\"This isn\\'t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\\nCome on.\"\\n\\u3000And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\n\\u3000The snow still hadn\\'t melted the next morning.\\n\\u3000\"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"No.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why don\\'t we go down and visit Hagrid?\"\\n\\u3000\"No... you go...\"\\n\\u3000\"I know what you\\'re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\'t go\\nback tonight.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why not?\"\\n\\u3000\"I dunno, I\\'ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you\\'ve\\nhad too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are\\nwandering around. So what if they can\\'t see you? What if they walk\\ninto you? What if you knock something over?\"\\n\\u3000\"You sound like Hermione.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m serious, Harry, don\\'t go.\"\\n\\u3000But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back\\nin front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\'t going to stop him.\\n\\u3000That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was\\nwalking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but\\nhe didn\\'t meet anyone.\\n\\u3000And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one\\nof his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the\\nfloor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from\\nstaying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.\\n\\u3000Except --\\n\\u3000\"So -- back again, Harry?\"\\n\\u3000Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind\\nhim. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus\\nDumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate\\nto get to the mirror he hadn\\'t noticed him.\\n\\u3000\" -- I didn\\'t see you, sir.\"\\n\\u3000\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said\\nDumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\n\\u3000\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\\nHarry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of\\nthe Mirror of Erised.\"\\n\\u3000\"I didn\\'t know it was called that, Sir.\"\\n\\u3000\"But I expect you\\'ve realized by now what it does?\"\\n\\u3000\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\"\\n\\u3000\"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"\\n\\u3000\"How did you know --?\"\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.\\n\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"\\n\\u3000Harry shook his head.\\n\\u3000\"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use\\nthe Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it\\nand see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\"\\n\\u3000Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want...\\nwhatever we want...\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or\\nless than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who\\nhave never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald\\nWeasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees\\nhimself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror\\nwill give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before\\nit, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not\\nknowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\n\\u3000\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I\\nask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you\\nwill now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to\\nlive, remember that. Now, why don\\'t you put that admirable cloak\\nback on and get off to bed?\"\\n\\u3000Harry stood up.\\n\\u3000\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\"\\n\\u3000\"Obviously, you\\'ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask\\nme one more thing, however.\"\\n\\u3000\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"\\n\\u3000\"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"\\n\\u3000Harry stared.\\n\\u3000\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another\\nChristmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will\\ninsist on giving me books.\"\\n\\u3000It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that\\nDumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought,\\nas he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal\\nquestion.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER THIRTEEN: NICOLAS FLAMEL\\n\\u3000Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror\\nof Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the\\ninvisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry\\nwished he could forget what he\\'d seen in the mirror as easily, but he\\ncouldn\\'t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he\\ndreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while\\na high voice cackled with laughter.\\n\\u3000\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\"\\nsaid Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.\\n\\u3000Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a\\ndifferent view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of\\nHarry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If\\nFilch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\\'t at least\\nfound out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\n\\u3000They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary\\nbook, even though Harry was still sure he\\'d read the name\\nsomewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming\\nthrough books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even\\nless time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started\\nagain.\\n\\u3000Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain\\nthat had replaced the snow couldn\\'t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys\\ncomplained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on\\nWood\\'s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they\\nwould overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time\\nin seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he\\nhad fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\\n\\u3000Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session,\\nWood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\\'d just gotten very angry\\nwith the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending\\nto fall off their brooms.\\n\\u3000\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\\'s exactly the sort of\\nthing that\\'ll lose us the match! Snape\\'s refereeing this time, and he\\'ll\\nbe looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"\\n\\u3000George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\n\\u3000\"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.\\n\"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair\\nif we might overtake Slytherin.\"\\n\\u3000The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play\\na clean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\"\\n\\u3000Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason\\nfor not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....\\n\\u3000The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the\\nend of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor\\ncommon room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess.\\nChess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and\\nRon thought was very good for her.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down\\nnext to him, \"I need to concen --\" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face.\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you? You look terrible.\"\\n\\u3000Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the\\nother two about Snape\\'s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch\\nreferee.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once.\\n\\u3000\"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\\n\\u3000\"Really break your leg,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,\\nGryffindor can\\'t play at all.\"\\n\\u3000At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he\\nhad managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\'s guess,\\nbecause his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at\\nonce as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the\\nway up to Gryffindor tower.\\n\\u3000Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and\\nperformed the countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to\\nhis feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading\\nhim over to sit with Harry and Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He\\nsaid he\\'d been looking for someone to practice that on.\"\\n\\u3000\"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report\\nhim!\"\\n\\u3000Neville shook his head.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t want more trouble,\" he mumbled.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\\'s used to\\nwalking all over people, but that\\'s no reason to lie down in front of\\nhim and make it easier.\"\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\\nMalfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out.\\n\\u3000Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate\\nFrog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for\\nChristmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose\\nyou for Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking\\nSlytherin.\"\\n\\u3000Neville\\'s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\\n\\u3000\"Thanks, Harry... I think I\\'ll go to bed.... D\\'you want the card, you\\ncollect them, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\u3000As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\n\\u3000\"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever-\"\\n\\u3000He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at\\nRon and Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\\'ve found Flamel! I told you I\\'d\\nread the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here --\\nlisten to this: \\'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the\\ndark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses\\nof dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas\\nFlamel\\'!\"\\n\\u3000Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\\'t looked so excited since\\nthey\\'d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\n\\u3000\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\'\\ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified\\nlooks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\n\\u3000\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this\\nout of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\\n\\u3000\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d\\nlooked something up, and started flicking frantically through the\\npages, muttering to herself.\\n\\u3000At last she found what she was looking for.\\n\\u3000\"I knew it! I knew it!\"\\n\\u3000\"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione\\nignored him.\\n\\u3000\"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known\\nmaker of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\"\\n\\u3000This didn\\'t have quite the effect she\\'d expected.\\n\\u3000\"The what?\" said Harry and Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, honestly, don\\'t you two read? Look -- read that, there.\"\\n\\u3000She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The\\nancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\\'s\\nStone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will\\ntransform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life,\\nwhich will make the drinker immortal.\\n\\u3000There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone over the\\ncenturies, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr.\\nNicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who\\ncelebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a\\nquiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-\\neight).\\n\\u3000\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog\\nmust be guarding Flamel\\'s Sorcerer\\'s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore\\nto keep it safe for him, because they\\'re friends and he knew someone\\nwas after it, that\\'s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"\\n\\u3000\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said\\nHarry. \"No wonder Snape\\'s after it! Anyone would want it.\"\\n\\u3000\"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in that Study of Recent\\nDevelopments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s\\nsix hundred and sixty-five, is he?\"\\n\\u3000The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying\\ndown different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were\\nstill discussing what they\\'d do with a Sorcerer\\'s Stone if they had one.\\nIt wasn\\'t until Ron said he\\'d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry\\nremembered about Snape and the coming match.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the\\nSlytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll show them...\\nit\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\"\\n\\u3000\"Just as long as we\\'re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione.\\n\\u3000As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more\\nnervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team\\nwasn\\'t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house\\nchampionship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but\\nwould they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he\\nseemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he\\neven wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him\\non his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture,\\nSnape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\\'d\\nfound out about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone? Harry didn\\'t see how he could --\\nyet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read\\nminds.\\n\\u3000Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker\\nrooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering\\nwhether they\\'d ever see him alive again. This wasn\\'t what you\\'d call\\ncomforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\\'s pep talk as he\\npulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two\\nThousand.\\n\\u3000Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next\\nto Neville, who couldn\\'t understand why they looked so grim and\\nworried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match.\\nLittle did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly\\npracticing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\\'d gotten the idea from Malfoy\\nusing it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed\\nany sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Now, don\\'t forget, it\\'s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as\\nRon slipped his wand up his sleeve.\\n\\u3000\"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\\'t nag.\"\\n\\u3000Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early\\ncapture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor\\nHufflepuff too much.\"\\n\\u3000\"The whole school\\'s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the\\ndoor. \"Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore\\'s come to watch!\"\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s heart did a somersault.\\n\\u3000\"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was\\nright. There was no mistaking that silver beard.\\n\\u3000Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There\\nwas simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if\\nDumbledore was watching.\\n\\u3000Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams\\nmarched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look -\\nthey\\'re off Ouch!\"\\n\\u3000Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\'t see you there.\"\\n\\u3000Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\n\\u3000\"Wonder how long Potter\\'s going to stay on his broom this time?\\nAnyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\"\\n\\u3000Ron didn\\'t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty\\nbecause George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had\\nall her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who\\nwas circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\n\\u3000\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor\\nteam?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded\\nHufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It\\'s people they feel\\nsorry for. See, there\\'s Potter, who\\'s got no parents, then there\\'s the\\nWeasleys, who\\'ve got no money -- you should be on the team,\\nLongbottom, you\\'ve got no brains.\"\\n\\u3000Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered.\\n\\u3000Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not\\ndaring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\"\\n\\u3000\"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\'d be poorer than Weasley, and\\nthat\\'s saying something.\"\\n\\u3000Ron\\'s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with\\nanxiety about Harry.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word\\n\\u3000\"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry --\"\\n\\u3000\"What? Where?\"\\n\\u3000Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps\\nand cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in\\nher mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\'s obviously spotted some money on\\nthe ground!\" said Malfoy.\\n\\u3000Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on\\ntop of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then\\nclambered over the back of his seat to help.\\n\\u3000\"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to\\nwatch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy\\nand Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps\\ncoming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\n\\u3000Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next\\nsecond, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph,\\nthe Snitch clasped in his hand.\\n\\u3000The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever\\nremember the Snitch being caught so quickly.\\n\\u3000\"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve\\nwon! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and\\ndown on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\n\\u3000Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\'t\\nbelieve it. He\\'d done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five\\nminutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape\\nland nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on\\nhis shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\'s smiling face.\\n\\u3000\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could\\nhear. \"Nice to see you haven\\'t been brooding about that mirror... been\\nkeeping busy... excellent...\"\\n\\u3000Snape spat bitterly on the ground.\\n\\u3000Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus\\nTwo Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\'t ever remember\\nfeeling happier. He\\'d really done something to be proud of now -- no\\none could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air\\nhad never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving\\nthe last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running\\nto lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance,\\njumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\n\\u3000Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door\\nand looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the\\nsetting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\\'d done it, he\\'d shown Snape....\\n\\u3000And speaking of Snape...\\n\\u3000A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.\\nClearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the\\nforbidden forest. Harry\\'s victory faded from his mind as he watched.\\nHe recognized the figure\\'s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the\\nforest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?\\n\\u3000Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.\\nGliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run.\\nHe followed.\\n\\u3000The trees were so thick he couldn\\'t see where Snape had gone. He\\nflew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees\\nuntil he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly\\nin a towering beech tree.\\n\\u3000He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\\nbroomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy\\nclearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\\'t alone. Quirrell was there, too.\\nHarry couldn\\'t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering\\nworse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\\n\\u3000\"... d-don\\'t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,\\nSeverus...\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, I thought we\\'d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy.\\n\"Students aren\\'t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, after\\nall.\"\\n\\u3000Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape\\ninterrupted him.\\n\\u3000\"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\'s yet?\"\\n\\u3000\"B-b-but Severus, I --\"\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a\\nstep toward him.\\n\\u3000\"I-I don\\'t know what you\\n\\u3000\"You know perfectly well what I mean.\"\\n\\u3000An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He\\nsteadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \"-- your little bit of hocus-\\npocus. I\\'m waiting.\"\\n\\u3000\"B-but I d-d-don\\'t --\"\\n\\u3000\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\\'ll have another little chat soon, when\\nyou\\'ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties\\nlie.\"\\n\\u3000He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It\\nwas almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still\\nas though he was petrified.\\n\\u3000\"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked.\\n\\u3000\"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the\\nback. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on\\nCrabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam\\nPomftey says he\\'ll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin!\\nEveryone\\'s waiting for you in the common room, we\\'re having a party,\\nFred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\"\\n\\u3000\"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\\'s find an empty\\nroom, you wait \\'til you hear this....\"\\n\\u3000He made sure Peeves wasn\\'t inside before shutting the door behind\\nthem, then he told them what he\\'d seen and heard.\\n\\u3000\"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to\\nforce Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past\\nFluffy - and he said something about Quirrell\\'s \\'hocus pocuss-- I reckon\\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of\\nenchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-\\nDark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through --\"\\n\\u3000\"So you mean the Stone\\'s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\\nSnape?\" said Hermione in alarm.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER FOURTEEN: NORBERT THE\\nNORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\\n\\u3000Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\'d thought. In\\nthe weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner,\\nbut it didn\\'t look as though he\\'d cracked yet.\\n\\u3000Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\\nstill growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad\\ntemper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever\\nHarry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of\\nsmile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\\'s\\nstutter.\\n\\u3000Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\\'s\\nStone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all\\nher notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\\'t have minded, but she kept nagging\\nthem to do the same.\\n\\u3000\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\"\\n\\u3000\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a\\nsecond to Nicolas Flamel.\"\\n\\u3000\"But we\\'re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway,\\nwhat are you studying for, you already know it A.\"\\n\\u3000\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to\\npass these exams to get into the second year? They\\'re very important,\\nI should have started studying a month ago, I don\\'t know what\\'s\\ngotten into me....\"\\n\\u3000Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same\\nlines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the\\nEaster holidays weren\\'t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It\\nwas hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses\\nof dragon\\'s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and\\nyawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library\\nwith her, trying to get through all their extra work.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing\\ndown his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was\\nthe first really fine day they\\'d had in months. The sky was a clear,\\nforget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer\\ncoming.\\n\\u3000Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical\\nHerbs and Fungi, didn\\'t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What\\nare you doing in the library?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He\\nlooked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\\n\\u3000\"Jus\\' lookin\\',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.\\n\"An\\' what\\'re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not\\nstill lookin\\' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is\\nages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog\\'s\\nguarding, it\\'s a Sorcerer\\'s St --\"\\n\\u3000\"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was\\nlistening. \"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\"\\n\\u3000\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\"\\nsaid Harry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\"\\n\\u3000\"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an\\' see me later, I\\'m not\\npromisin\\' I\\'ll tell yeh anythin\\', mind, but don\\' go rabbitin\\' about it in\\nhere, students aren\\' s\\'pposed ter know. They\\'ll think I\\'ve told yeh --\"\\n\\u3000\"See you later, then,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000Hagrid shuffled off.\\n\\u3000\"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully.\\n\\u3000\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who\\'d had\\nenough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books\\nin his arms and slammed them down on the table.\\n\\u3000\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about\\ndragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland;\\nFrom Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide.\"\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid\\'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever\\nmet him, \" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"But it\\'s against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed\\nby the Warlocks\\' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\'s hard\\nto stop Muggles from noticing us if we\\'re keeping dragons in the back\\ngarden - anyway, you can\\'t tame dragons, it\\'s dangerous. You should\\nsee the burns Charlie\\'s got off wild ones in Romania.\"\\n\\u3000\"But there aren\\'t wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and\\nHebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I\\ncan tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\'ve\\nspotted them, to make them forget.\"\\n\\u3000\"So what on earths Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.\\n\\u3000When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour\\nlater, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed.\\nHagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the\\ndoor quickly behind them.\\n\\u3000It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there\\nwas a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered\\nthem stoat sandwiches, which they refused.\\n\\u3000\"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We\\nwere wondering if you could tell us what\\'s guarding the Sorcerer\\'s\\nStone apart from Fluffy.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid frowned at him.\\n\\u3000\"0\\' course I cant, he said. \"Number one, I don\\' know meself. Number\\ntwo, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\' tell yeh if I could. That\\nStone\\'s here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I\\ns\\'ppose yeh\\'ve worked that out an\\' all? Beats me how yeh even know\\nabou\\' Fluffy.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do\\nknow, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione\\nin a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\\'s beard twitched and they could\\ntell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding,\\nreally.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had\\ntrusted enough to help him, apart from you.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid\\'s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\\nHermione.\\n\\u3000\"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let\\'s see... he\\nborrowed Fluffy from me... then some o\\' the teachers did\\nenchantments... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor\\nMcGonagall --\" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell --\\nan\\' Dumbledore himself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve\\nforgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\"\\n\\u3000\"Snape?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah -- yer not still on abou\\' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped\\nprotect the Stone, he\\'s not about ter steal it.\"\\n\\u3000Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\\nSnape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to\\nfind out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew\\neverything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell\\'s spell and how to get past\\nFluffy.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\'t you,\\nHagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\'t tell anyone, would\\nyou? Not even one of the teachers?\"\\n\\u3000\"Not a soul knows except me an\\' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.\\n\\u3000\"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can\\nwe have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\"\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the\\nfire. Harry looked at it, too.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid -- what\\'s that?\"\\n\\u3000But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,\\nunderneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\n\\u3000\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That\\'s er...\"\\n\\u3000\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to\\nget a closer look at the egg. \"It must\\'ve cost you a fortune.\"\\n\\u3000\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a\\nfew drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he was\\nquite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\\n\\u3000\"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said\\nHermione.\\n\\u3000\"Well, I\\'ve bin doin\\' some readin\\' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book\\nfrom under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding\\nfor Pleasure and Profit -- it\\'s a bit outta date, o\\' course, but it\\'s all in\\nhere. Keep the egg in the fire, \\'cause their mothers breathe on I em,\\nsee, an\\' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\' brandy mixed with\\nchicken blood every half hour. An\\' see here -- how ter recognize\\ndiff\\'rent eggs -- what I got there\\'s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\'re\\nrare, them.\"\\n\\u3000He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\\'t.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.\\n\\u3000But Hagrid wasn\\'t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked\\nthe fire.\\n\\u3000So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen\\nto Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his\\nhut. \"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as\\nevening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework\\nthey were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules\\nfor Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.\\n\\u3000Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\\nHagrid. He had written only two words: It\\'s hatching.\\n\\u3000Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.\\nHermione wouldn\\'t hear of it.\\n\\u3000\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a\\ndragon hatching?\"\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve got lessons, we\\'ll get into trouble, and that\\'s nothing to what\\nHagrid\\'s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\'s doing --\"\\n\\u3000\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\\n\\u3000Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen.\\nHow much had he heard? Harry didn\\'t like the look on Malfoy\\'s face\\nat all.\\n\\u3000Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\'s with the other two during\\nmorning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of\\ntheir lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and\\nhurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted\\nthem, looking flushed and excited.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\\n\\u3000The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it.\\nSomething was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from\\nit.\\n\\u3000They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated\\nbreath.\\n\\u3000All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The\\nbaby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\\'t exactly pretty; Harry\\nthought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings\\nwere huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with\\nwide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\\n\\u3000It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\n\\u3000\"Isn\\'t he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to\\nstroke the dragon\\'s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed\\nfangs.\\n\\u3000\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\\nexactly?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from\\nhis face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\u3000\"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains -- it\\'s a kid --\\nhe\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\"\\n\\u3000Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there\\nwas no mistaking him.\\n\\u3000Malfoy had seen the dragon.\\n\\u3000Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy\\'s face during the next\\nweek made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most\\nof their free time in Hagrid\\'s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\\n\\u3000\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\\n\\u3000\"I can\\'t,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s too little. He\\'d die.\"\\n\\u3000They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in\\njust a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\'t been\\ndoing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so\\nbusy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over\\nthe floor.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the\\ndragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert!\\nNorbert! Where\\'s Mommy?\"\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\'s going\\nto be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any\\nmoment.\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid bit his lip.\\n\\u3000\"I -- I know I can\\'t keep him forever, but I can\\'t jus\\' dump him, I\\ncan\\'t.\"\\n\\u3000Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\'m Ron, remember?\"\\n\\u3000\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying\\ndragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him\\nand then put him back in the wild!\"\\n\\u3000\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"\\n\\u3000And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to\\nCharlie to ask him.\\n\\u3000The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione\\nand Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else\\nhad gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just\\n\\u3000chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared\\nout of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\\'s invisibility cloak. He had been\\ndown at Hagrid\\'s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating\\ndead rats by the crate.\\n\\u3000\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in\\na bloody handkerchief. \"I\\'m not going to be able to hold a quill for a\\nweek. I tell you, that dragon\\'s the most horrible animal I\\'ve ever met,\\nbut the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\'d think it was a fluffy little\\nbunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And\\nwhen I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\\n\\u3000There was a tap on the dark window.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\'ll have\\nCharlie\\'s answer!\"\\n\\u3000The three of them put their heads together to read the note.\\n\\u3000Dear Ron,\\n\\u3000How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I\\'d be glad to take the\\nNorwegian Ridgeback, but it won\\'t be easy getting him here. I think\\nthe best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who\\nare coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\\'t be seen\\ncarrying an illegal dragon.\\n\\u3000Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on\\nSaturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\\'s still\\ndark.\\n\\u3000Send me an answer as soon as possible.\\n\\u3000Love,\\n\\u3000Charlie\\n\\u3000They looked at one another.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\'t be too\\ndifficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and\\nNorbert.\"\\n\\u3000It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\\nagreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.\\n\\u3000There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\'s bitten hand had\\nswollen to twice its usual size. He didn\\'t know whether it was safe to\\ngo to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the\\nafternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade\\nof green. It looked as if Norbert\\'s fangs were poisonous.\\n\\u3000Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of\\nthe day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\'s\\nabout to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow\\none of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He\\nkept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I\\'ve told her it was a\\ndog, but I don\\'t think she believes me -I shouldn\\'t have hit him at the\\nQuidditch match, that\\'s why he\\'s doing this.\"\\n\\u3000Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this\\ndidn\\'t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke\\ninto a sweat.\\n\\u3000\"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no --\\nI\\'ve just remembered -- Charlie\\'s letter was in that book Malfoy took,\\nhe\\'s going to know we\\'re getting rid of Norbert.\"\\n\\u3000Harry and Hermione didn\\'t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey\\ncame over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed\\nsleep.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We\\nhaven\\'t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our\\nonly chance to get rid of Norbert. We\\'ll have to risk it. And we have\\ngot the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn\\'t know about that.\"\\n\\u3000They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged\\ntail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to\\nthem.\\n\\u3000\"I won\\'t let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert\\'s at a tricky stage -- nothin\\' I\\ncan\\'t handle.\"\\n\\u3000When they told him about Charlie\\'s letter, his eyes filled with tears,\\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on\\nthe leg.\\n\\u3000\"Aargh! It\\'s all right, he only got my boot -- jus\\' playin\\' -- he\\'s only a\\nbaby, after all.\"\\n\\u3000The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle.\\nHarry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday\\ncouldn\\'t come quickly enough.\\n\\u3000They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him\\nto say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn\\'t been so worried about what\\nthey had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit\\nlate arriving at Hagrid\\'s hut because they\\'d had to wait for Peeves to\\nget out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\\'d been playing\\ntennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a\\nlarge crate.\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s got lots o\\' rats an\\' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in\\na muffled voice. \"An\\' I\\'ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\"\\n\\u3000From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\\n\\u3000\"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered\\nthe crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it\\nthemselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\"\\n\\u3000How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\\nknew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble\\nstaircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another\\nstaircase, then another -- even one of Harry\\'s shortcuts didn\\'t make the\\nwork much easier.\\n\\u3000\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath\\nthe tallest tower.\\n\\u3000Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop\\nthe crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into\\nthe shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with\\neach other ten feet away. A lamp flared.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had\\nMalfoy by the ear.\\n\\u3000\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin!\\nWandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --\"\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\'s coming -- he\\'s got a\\ndragon!\"\\n\\u3000\"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall\\nsee Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\\n\\u3000The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the\\neasiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\\'d stepped out into\\nthe cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to\\nbreathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\\n\\u3000\"Malfoy\\'s got detention! I could sing!\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t,\" Harry advised her.\\n\\u3000Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in\\nhis crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping\\ndown out of the darkness.\\n\\u3000Charlie\\'s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and\\nHermione the harness they\\'d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert\\nbetween them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then\\nHarry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them\\nvery much.\\n\\u3000At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.\\n\\u3000They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy\\nin detention -- what could spoil their happiness?\\n\\u3000The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they\\nstepped into the corridor, Filch\\'s face loomed suddenly out of the\\ndarkness.\\n\\u3000\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"\\n\\u3000They\\'d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER FIFTEEN: THE FORIBIDDEN\\nFOREST\\n\\u3000Things couldn\\'t have been worse.\\n\\u3000Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\'s study on the first\\nfloor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.\\nHermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories\\nchased each other around Harry\\'s brain, each more feeble than the\\nlast. He couldn\\'t see how they were going to get out of trouble this\\ntime. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to\\nforget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor\\nMcGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping\\naround the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest\\nastronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add\\nNorbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing\\ntheir bags already.\\n\\u3000Had Harry thought that things couldn\\'t have been worse? He was\\nwrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading\\nNeville.\\n\\u3000\"Harry!\" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was\\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to\\ncatch you, he said you had a drag --\"\\n\\u3000Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than\\nNorbert as she towered over the three of them.\\n\\u3000\"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you\\nwere up in the astronomy tower. It\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning.\\nExplain yourselves.\"\\n\\u3000It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\'s\\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\n\\u3000\"I think I\\'ve got a good idea of what\\'s been going on,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall. \"It doesn\\'t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco\\nMalfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out\\nof bed and into trouble. I\\'ve already caught him. I suppose you think\\nit\\'s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\"\\n\\u3000Harry caught Neville\\'s eye and tried to tell him without words that\\nthis wasn\\'t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,\\nblundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try\\nand find them in the dark, to warn them.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of\\nbed in one night! I\\'ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss\\nGranger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I\\nthought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will\\nreceive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you\\nthe right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\'s\\nvery dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\"\\n\\u3000\"Fifty?\" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he\\'d won\\nin the last Quidditch match.\\n\\u3000\"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\\nthrough her long, pointed nose.\\n\\u3000\"Professor -- please\\n\\u3000\"You can\\'t --\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t tell me what I can and can\\'t do, Potter. Now get back to bed,\\nall of you. I\\'ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\"\\n\\u3000A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In\\none night, they\\'d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house\\ncup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\\nHow could they ever make up for this?\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\'t think of anything to\\nsay to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the\\ndawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out\\nwhat they\\'d done?\\n\\u3000At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the\\nhouse points the next day thought there\\'d been a mistake. How could\\nthey suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?\\nAnd then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry\\nPotter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those\\npoints, him and a couple of other stupid first years.\\n\\u3000From being one of the most popular and admired people at the\\nschool, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and\\nHufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see\\nSlytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed\\nand didn\\'t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him.\\nSlytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them,\\nwhistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\"\\n\\u3000Only Ron stood by him.\\n\\u3000\"They\\'ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost\\nloads of points in all the time they\\'ve been here, and people still like\\nthem.\"\\n\\u3000\"They\\'ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though,\\nhave they?\" said Harry miserably.\\n\\u3000\"Well -- no,\" Ron admitted.\\n\\u3000It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself\\nnot to meddle in things that weren\\'t his business from now on. He\\'d\\nhad it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself\\nthat he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\n\\u3000\"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good\\'ll that do? How are we\\ngoing to get any points back if we can\\'t win at Quidditch?\"\\n\\u3000But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\'t\\nspeak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him,\\nthey called him \"the Seeker.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\'t have as bad a\\ntime as Harry, because they weren\\'t as well-known, but nobody would\\nspeak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to\\nherself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.\\n\\u3000Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\\'t far away. All the\\nstudying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and\\nHermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to\\nremember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and\\nspells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin\\nrebellions....\\n\\u3000Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\'s new\\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\'t concern him was put\\nto an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one\\nafternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up\\nahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\\'s voice.\\n\\u3000\"No -- no -- not again, please --\"\\n\\u3000It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved\\ncloser.\\n\\u3000\"All right -- all right --\" he heard Quirrell sob.\\n\\u3000Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom\\nstraightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was\\nabout to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\\'t think Quirrell had\\neven noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\\'s footsteps had\\ndisappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door\\nstood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he\\nremembered what he\\'d promised himself about not meddling.\\n\\u3000All the same, he\\'d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\'s Stones that Snape\\nhad just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape\\nwould be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to\\nhave given in at last.\\n\\u3000Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he\\'d heard.\\n\\u3000\"Snape\\'s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\'s told him how to break\\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell --\"\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"Maybe Snape\\'s found out how to get past him without asking\\nHagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding\\nthem. \"I bet there\\'s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get\\npast a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\"\\n\\u3000The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\'s eyes, but\\nHermione answered before Harry could.\\n\\u3000\"Go to Dumbledore. That\\'s what we should have done ages ago. If\\nwe try anything ourselves we\\'ll be thrown out for sure.\"\\n\\u3000\"But we\\'ve got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell\\'s too scared to back\\nus up. Snape\\'s only got to say he doesn\\'t know how the troll got in at\\nHalloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you\\nthink they\\'ll believe, him or us? It\\'s not exactly a secret we hate him,\\nDumbledore\\'ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\'t\\nhelp us if his life depended on it, he\\'s too friendly with Snape, and the\\nmore students get thrown out, the better, he\\'ll think. And don\\'t forget,\\nwe\\'re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\'ll take a\\nlot of explaining.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\'t.\\n\\u3000\"If we just do a bit of poking around --\"\\n\\u3000\"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\'ve done enough poking around.\"\\n\\u3000He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the\\nnames of its moons.\\n\\u3000The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione,\\nand Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\\n\\u3000Your detention will take place at eleven o\\'clock tonight. Meet Mr.\\nFilch in the entrance hall.\\n\\u3000Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions\\nto do in the furor over the points they\\'d lost. He half expected\\nHermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but\\nshe didn\\'t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\\'d\\ngot.\\n\\u3000At eleven o\\'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the\\ncommon room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch\\nwas already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that\\nMalfoy had gotten a detention, too.\\n\\u3000\"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\n\\u3000I bet you\\'ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\'t\\nyou, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes... hard work and pain are\\nthe best teachers if you ask me.... It\\'s just a pity they let the old\\npunishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a\\nfew days, I\\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \\'em well oiled in\\ncase they\\'re ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don\\'t think of\\nrunning off, now, it\\'ll be worse for you if you do.\"\\n\\u3000They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing.\\nHarry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be\\nsomething really horrible, or Filch wouldn\\'t be sounding so delighted.\\n\\u3000The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing\\nthem into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of\\nHagrid\\'s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.\\n\\u3000\"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\"\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\\nwouldn\\'t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because\\nFilch said, \"I suppose you think you\\'ll be enjoying yourself with that\\noaf? Well, think again, boy -- it\\'s into the forest you\\'re going and I\\'m\\nmuch mistaken if you\\'ll all come out in one piece.\"\\n\\u3000At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\\ntracks.\\n\\u3000\"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\'t sound quite as cool as usual.\\n\"We can\\'t go in there at night -- there\\'s all sorts of things in there --\\nwerewolves, I heard.\"\\n\\u3000Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\'s robe and made a choking\\nnoise.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s your problem, isn\\'t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with\\nglee. \"Should\\'ve thought of them werewolves before you got in\\ntrouble, shouldn\\'t you?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel.\\nHe was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over\\nhis shoulder.\\n\\u3000\"Abou\\' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\' fer half an hour already. All\\nright, Harry, Hermione?\"\\n\\u3000\"I shouldn\\'t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly,\\nthey\\'re here to be punished, after all.\"\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin\\nlecturin\\' them, eh? \\'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\'ve done yer bit, I\\'ll\\ntake over from here.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\'s left of them,\" he added\\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp\\nbobbing away in the darkness.\\n\\u3000Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear\\nthe note of panic in his voice.\\n\\u3000\"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely.\\n\"Yeh\\'ve done wrong an\\' now yehve got ter pay fer it.\"\\n\\u3000\"But this is servant stuff, it\\'s not for students to do. I thought we\\'d be\\ncopying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\'d\\n\\u3000tell yer that\\'s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\' lines!\\nWhat good\\'s that ter anyone? Yeh\\'ll do summat useful or Yeh\\'ll get\\nout. If yeh think yer father\\'d rather you were expelled, then get back\\noff ter the castle an\\' pack. Go on\"\\'\\n\\u3000Malfoy didn\\'t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then\\ndropped his gaze.\\n\\u3000\"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, \\'cause it\\'s\\ndangerous what we\\'re gonna do tonight, an\\' I don\\' want no one takin\\'\\nrisks. Follow me over here a moment.\"\\n\\u3000He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up\\nhigh, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared\\ninto the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they\\nlooked into the forest.\\n\\u3000\"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\' on the ground?\\nSilvery stuff? That\\'s unicorn blood. There\\'s a unicorn in there bin hurt\\nbadly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead\\nlast Wednesday. We\\'re gonna try an\\' find the poor thing. We might\\nhave ter put it out of its misery.\"\\n\\u3000\"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy,\\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s nothin\\' that lives in the forest that\\'ll hurt yeh if yer with me\\nor Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\'re gonna\\nsplit inter two parties an\\' follow the trail in diff\\'rent directions. There\\'s\\nblood all over the place, it must\\'ve bin staggerin\\' around since last\\nnight at least.\"\\n\\u3000\"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\'s long teeth.\\n\\u3000\"All right, but I warn yeh, he\\'s a coward,\" said Hagrid. \" So me,\\nHarry, an\\' Hermione\\'ll go one way an\\' Draco, Neville, an\\' Fang\\'ll go the\\nother. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\'ll send up green sparks,\\nright? Get yer wands out an\\' practice now -- that\\'s it -- an\\' if anyone\\ngets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\' we\\'ll all come an\\' find yeh -- so,\\nbe careful -- let\\'s go.\"\\n\\u3000The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a\\nfork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left\\npath while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.\\n\\u3000They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and\\nthen a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of\\nsilver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.\\n\\u3000Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\n\\u3000\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.\\n\\u3000\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\'s not easy ter catch a unicorn,\\nthey\\'re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt\\nbefore.\"\\n\\u3000They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running\\nwater; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still\\nspots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.\\n\\u3000\"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\' worry, it can\\'t\\'ve\\ngone far if it\\'s this badly hurt, an\\' then we\\'ll be able ter -- GET BEHIND\\nTHAT TREE!\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path\\nbehind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his\\ncrossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened.\\nSomething was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a\\ncloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark\\npath, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\\n\\u3000\"I knew it, \" he murmured. \"There\\'s summat in here that shouldn\\'\\nbe.\"\\n\\u3000\"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested.\\n\\u3000\"That wasn\\' no werewolf an\\' it wasn\\' no unicorn, neither,\" said\\nHagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"\\n\\u3000They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.\\nSuddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\n\\u3000\"Who\\'s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself -- I\\'m armed!\"\\n\\u3000And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist,\\na man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\'s gleaming\\nchestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\'s jaws\\ndropped.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, it\\'s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"\\n\\u3000He walked forward and shook the centaur\\'s hand.\\n\\u3000\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep,\\nsorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"\\n\\u3000\"Can\\'t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\\n\"There\\'s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\'\\nHermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\' this is\\nRonan, you two. He\\'s a centaur.))\\n\\u3000\"We\\'d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.\\n\\u3000\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn\\nmuch, up at the school?\"\\n\\u3000\"Erm --\"\\n\\u3000\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.\\n\\u3000\"A bit. Well, that\\'s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his\\nhead and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\'m glad we\\'ve run\\ninter yeh, Ronan, \\'cause there\\'s a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen\\nanythin\\'?\"\\n\\u3000Ronan didn\\'t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward,\\nthen sighed again.\\n\\u3000\"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been\\nfor ages past, so it is now.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\', Ronan? Anythin\\'\\nunusual?\"\\n\\u3000\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\\nimpatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah, but I was meanin\\' anythin\\' unusual a bit nearer home, said\\nHagrid. \"So yeh haven\\'t noticed anythin\\' strange?\"\\n\\u3000Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest\\nhides many secrets.\"\\n\\u3000A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow\\nagain, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and\\nwilder-looking than Ronan.\\n\\u3000\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"\\n\\u3000\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well enough. Look, I\\'ve jus\\' bin askin\\' Ronan, you seen anythin\\' odd\\nin here lately? There\\'s a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know\\nanythin\\' about it?\"\\n\\u3000Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars\\nis bright tonight,\" he said simply.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see\\nanythin\\', let me know, won\\'t yeh? We\\'ll be off, then.\"\\n\\u3000Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over\\ntheir shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\n\\u3000\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\' get a straight answer out of a\\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\' closer\\'n the\\nmoon.\"\\n\\u3000\"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\'re\\ngood enough about turnin\\' up if ever I want a word. They\\'re deep,\\nmind, centaurs... they know things... jus\\' don\\' let on much.\"\\n\\u3000\"D\\'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was\\nwhat\\'s bin killin\\' the unicorns -- never heard anythin\\' like it before.\"\\n\\u3000They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being\\nwatched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with\\nthem. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione\\ngrabbed Hagrid\\'s arm.\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"\\n\\u3000\"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\'ll come\\nback for yeh!\"\\n\\u3000They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\\nlooking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\\'t hear anything\\nbut the rustling of leaves around them.\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t think they\\'ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\'s got Neville... it\\'s our\\nfault he\\'s here in the first place.\"\\n\\u3000The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual.\\nHarry\\'s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking\\ntwig. What was going on? Where were the others?\\n\\u3000At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\'s return. Malfoy,\\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it\\nseemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke.\\nNeville had panicked and sent up the sparks.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\' now, with the racket you two were\\nmakin\\'. Right, we\\'re changin\\' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an\\'\\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\' this idiot. I\\'m sorry,\" Hagrid\\nadded in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\'ll have a harder time frightenin\\'\\nyou, an\\' we\\'ve gotta get this done.\"\\n\\u3000So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang.\\nThey walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the\\nforest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the\\ntrees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting\\nthicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor\\ncreature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see\\na clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\\n\\u3000\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\\n\\u3000Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched\\ncloser.\\n\\u3000It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at\\nodd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white\\non the dark leaves.\\n\\u3000Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made\\nhim freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing\\nquivered.... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling\\nacross the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang\\nstood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its\\nhead over the wound in the animal\\'s side, and began to drink its\\nblood.\\n\\u3000\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\\n\\u3000Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The\\nhooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn\\nblood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly\\ntoward Harry -- he couldn\\'t move for fear.\\n\\u3000Then a pain like he\\'d never felt before pierced his head; it was as\\nthough his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He\\nheard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean\\nover Harry, charging at the figure.\\n\\u3000The pain in Harry\\'s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a\\nminute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A\\ncentaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked\\nyounger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.\\n\\u3000\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\n\\u3000\"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\"\\n\\u3000The centaur didn\\'t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar\\nthat stood out, livid, on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\\u3000\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to\\nHagrid. The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you\\nride? It will be quicker this way.\\n\\u3000\"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his\\nfront legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\n\\u3000There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side\\nof the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their\\nflanks heaving and sweaty.\\n\\u3000\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human\\non your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\\n\\u3000\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy.\\nThe quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\\n\\u3000\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember,\\nFirenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have\\nwe not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\"\\n\\u3000Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\\'m sure Firenze thought he\\nwas acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice.\\n\\u3000Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\\n\\u3000\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned\\nwith what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like\\ndonkeys after stray humans in our forest!\"\\n\\u3000Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry\\nhad to grab his shoulders to stay on.\\n\\u3000\"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you\\nnot understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in\\non that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane,\\nyes, with humans alongside me if I must.\"\\n\\u3000And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he\\ncould, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind\\nthem.\\n\\u3000Harry didn\\'t have a clue what was going on.\\n\\u3000\"Why\\'s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved\\nme from, anyway?\"\\n\\u3000Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in\\ncase of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\'s question.\\nThey made their way through the trees in silence for so long that\\nHarry thought Firenze didn\\'t want to talk to him anymore. They were\\npassing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when\\nFirenze suddenly stopped.\\n\\u3000\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?\"\\n\\u3000\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\'ve only used the\\nhorn and tail hair in Potions.\"\\n\\u3000\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said\\nFirenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain,\\nwould commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you\\nalive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You\\nhave slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you\\nwill have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood\\ntouches your lips.\"\\n\\u3000Harry stared at the back of Firenze\\'s head, which was dappled silver\\nin the moonlight.\\n\\u3000\"But who\\'d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\'re going\\nto be cursed forever, deaths better, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\u3000\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long\\nenough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back\\nto full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never\\ndie. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very\\nmoment?\"\\n\\u3000\"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don\\'t\\nunderstand who --\"\\n\\u3000\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to\\npower, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\\n\\u3000It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\'s\\nheart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more\\nwhat Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he\\ndied. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left\\nin him to die.\"\\n\\u3000\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\\n\\u3000\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\\n\\u3000Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing\\nalong behind her.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The\\nunicorn\\'s dead, Hagrid, it\\'s in that clearing back there.\"\\n\\u3000\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off\\nto examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"\\n\\u3000Harry slid off his back.\\n\\u3000\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read\\nwrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those\\ntimes.\"\\n\\u3000He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving\\nHarry shivering behind him.\\n\\u3000Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them\\nto return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry\\nroughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was\\nwide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had\\nhappened in the forest.\\n\\u3000Harry couldn\\'t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire.\\nHe was still shaking.\\n\\u3000\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort\\'s waiting in\\nthe forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get\\nrich....\"\\n\\u3000\"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he\\nthought Voldemort could hear them.\\n\\u3000Harry wasn\\'t listening.\\n\\u3000\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\'t have done so.... Bane was\\nfurious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is\\ngoing to happen.... They must show that Voldemort\\'s coming back....\\nBane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose\\nthat\\'s written in the stars as well.\"\\n\\u3000\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.\\n\\u3000\"So all I\\'ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry\\nwent on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish\\nme off... Well, I suppose Bane\\'ll be happy.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\n\\u3000\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who\\nwas ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\'t\\ntouch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like\\nfortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\\'s a very\\nimprecise branch of magic.\"\\n\\u3000The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to\\nbed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\'s surprises weren\\'t\\nover.\\n\\u3000When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak\\nfolded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\n\\u3000Just in case.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER SIXTEEN: THROUGH THE\\nTRAPDOOR\\n\\u3000In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had\\nmanaged to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort\\nto come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept\\nby, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well\\nbehind the locked door.\\n\\u3000It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they\\ndid their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for\\nthe exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell.\\n\\u3000They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them\\none by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple\\ntapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a\\nmouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox\\nwas, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous,\\nbreathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to\\nmake a Forgetfulness potion.\\n\\u3000Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in\\nhis forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into\\nthe forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves\\nbecause Harry couldn\\'t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being\\nwoken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever\\nbecause there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.\\n\\u3000Maybe it was because they hadn\\'t seen what Harry had seen in the\\nforest, or because they didn\\'t have scars burning on their foreheads,\\nbut Ron and Hermione didn\\'t seem as worried about the Stone as\\nHarry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\'t\\nkeep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their\\nstudying they didn\\'t have much time to fret about what Snape or\\nanyone else might be up to.\\n\\u3000Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\\nquestions about batty old wizards who\\'d invented selfstirring\\ncauldrons and they\\'d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until\\ntheir exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told\\nthem to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry\\ncouldn\\'t help cheering with the rest.\\n\\u3000\"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as\\nthey joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t\\nhave learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the\\nuprising of Elfric the Eager.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward,\\nbut Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake\\nand flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were\\ntickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm\\nshallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on\\nthe grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week\\nbefore we find out how badly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry\\nyet.\"\\n\\u3000Harry was rubbing his forehead.\\n\\u3000\"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar\\nkeeps hurting -- it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\"\\n\\u3000\"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning... it means danger\\'s\\ncoming....\"\\n\\u3000Ron couldn\\'t get worked up, it was too hot.\\n\\u3000\"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as\\nDumbledore\\'s around. Anyway, we\\'ve never had any proof Snape\\nfound out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off\\nonce, he\\'s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play\\nQuidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\"\\n\\u3000Harry nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off a lurking feeling that there\\nwas something he\\'d forgotten to do, something important. When he\\ntried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That\\'s just the exams. I woke up\\nlast night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I\\nremembered we\\'d done that one.\"\\n\\u3000Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\'t have anything to\\ndo with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school\\nacross the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was\\nthe only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray\\nDumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy...\\nnever... but --\\n\\u3000Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\n\\u3000\"Where\\'re you going?\" said Ron sleepily.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white.\\n\"We\\'ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\\nslope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon,\\nand a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his\\npocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\\'s\\nagainst wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\\'t you think? Why\\ndidn\\'t I see it before?\"\\n\\u3000\"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across\\nthe grounds toward the forest, didn\\'t answer.\\n\\u3000Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\\nsleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\n\\u3000\"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\n\\u3000\"No, we\\'re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\'ve got to ask you something. You\\nknow that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were\\nplaying cards with look like?\"\\n\\u3000\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn\\' take his cloak off.\"\\n\\u3000He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\' funny folk in the Hog\\'s Head --\\nthat\\'s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\'\\nhe? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\\n\\u3000Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to\\nhim about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\\n\\u3000\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\\n\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an\\' I told him I was gamekeeper here....\\nHe asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him...\\nan\\' I said what I\\'d always really wanted was a dragon... an\\' then... I\\ncan\\' remember too well, \\'cause he kept buyin\\' me drinks.... Let\\'s see...\\nyeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\\' we could play cards fer it\\nif I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\\' want it\\nter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would\\nbe easy...\"\\n\\u3000\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing\\nto keep his voice calm.\\n\\u3000\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d\\'yeh meet, even\\naround Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\'s a piece o\\' cake if yeh know\\nhow to calm him down, jus\\' play him a bit o\\' music an\\' he\\'ll go straight\\noff ter sleep --\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\n\\u3000\"I shouldn\\'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey --\\nwhere\\'re yeh goin\\'?\"\\n\\u3000Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\'t speak to each other at all until\\nthey came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and\\ngloomy after the grounds.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that\\nstranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort\\nunder that cloak -- it must\\'ve been easy, once he\\'d got Hagrid drunk. I\\njust hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane\\ndoesn\\'t stop him. Where\\'s Dumbledore\\'s office?\"\\n\\u3000They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the\\nright direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived,\\nnor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ll just have to --\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across\\nthe hall.\\n\\u3000\"What are you three doing inside?\"\\n\\u3000It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\n\\u3000\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather\\nbravely, Harry and Ron thought.\\n\\u3000\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as\\nthough this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\\n\\u3000Harry swallowed -- now what?\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\'t, because\\nProfessor McGonagall\\'s nostrils flared.\\n\\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He\\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for\\nLondon at once.\"\\n\\u3000\"He\\'s gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"\\n\\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\\ndemands on his time --\\n\\u3000\"But this is important.\"\\n\\u3000\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\\nMagic, Potter.\\n\\u3000\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it\\'s\\nabout the Sorcerer\\'s tone --\"\\n\\u3000Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\'t that. The\\nbooks she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\'t pick\\nthem up. \"How do you know --?\" she spluttered.\\n\\u3000\"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone\\'s going to try\\nand steal the Stone. I\\'ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"\\n\\u3000She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\n\\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. I\\ndon\\'t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no\\none can possibly steal it, it\\'s too well protected.\"\\n\\u3000\"But Professor --\"\\n\\u3000\"Potter, I know what I\\'m talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent\\ndown and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back\\noutside and enjoy the sunshine.\"\\n\\u3000But they didn\\'t.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall\\nwas out of earshot. \"Snape\\'s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\'s\\nfound out everything he needs, and now he\\'s got Dumbledore out of\\nthe way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real\\nshock when Dumbledore turns up.\"\\n\\u3000\"But what can we --\"\\n\\u3000Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\n\\u3000Snape was standing there.\\n\\u3000\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.\\n\\u3000They stared at him.\\n\\u3000\"You shouldn\\'t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd,\\ntwisted smile.\\n\\u3000\"We were --\" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to\\nsay.\\n\\u3000\"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around\\n\\u3000like this, people will think you\\'re up to something. And Gryffindor\\nreally can\\'t afford to lose any more points, can it?\"\\n\\u3000Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them\\nback.\\n\\u3000\"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will\\npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\\n\\u3000He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\n\\u3000Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\n\\u3000\"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of\\nus has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and\\nfollow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\"\\n\\u3000\"Why me?\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\\nFlitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"\\'Oh Professor Flitwick,\\nI\\'m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....\\'\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out\\nfor Snape.\\n\\u3000\"And we\\'d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told\\nRon. \"Come on.\"\\n\\u3000But that part of the plan didn\\'t work. No sooner had they reached\\nthe door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor\\nMcGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\n\\u3000\"I suppose you think you\\'re harder to get past than a pack of\\nenchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you\\n\\'ve come anywhere near here again, I\\'ll take another fifty points from\\nGryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went\\nback to the common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione\\'s\\non Snape\\'s tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and\\nHermione came in.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I\\nwas doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get\\nhim, and I\\'ve only just got away, I don\\'t know where Snape went.\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, that\\'s it then, isn\\'t it?\" Harry said.\\n\\u3000The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were\\nglittering.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m going out of here tonight and I\\'m going to try and get to the\\nStone first.\"\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re mad!\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"You can\\'t!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have\\nsaid? You\\'ll be expelled!\"\\n\\u3000\"SO WHAP\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\'t you understand? If Snape gets\\nhold of the Stone, Voldemort\\'s coming back! Haven\\'t you heard what\\nit was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\'t be any\\nHogwarts to get expelled from! He\\'ll flatten it, or turn it into a school\\nfor the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\'t matter anymore, can\\'t you see?\\nD\\'you think he\\'ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins\\nthe house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\'ll\\nhave to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me\\nthere, it\\'s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\'m never\\ngoing over to the Dark Side! I\\'m going through that trapdoor tonight\\nand nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my\\nparents, remember?\"\\n\\u3000He glared at them.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'ll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s just lucky I got it\\nback.\"\\n\\u3000\"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"All -- all three of us?\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, come off it, you don\\'t think we\\'d let you go alone?\"\\n\\u3000\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you\\'d get\\nto the Stone without us? I\\'d better go and took through my books,\\nthere might be something useful...\"\\n\\u3000\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\\n\\u3000\"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in\\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re\\nnot throwing me out after that.\"\\n\\u3000After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common\\nroom. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to\\nsay to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\'t\\nbeen upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes,\\nhoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try\\nto break. Harry and Ron didn\\'t talk much. Both of them were thinking\\nabout what they were about to do.\\n\\u3000Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\n\\u3000\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory.\\nHe putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had\\ngiven him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn\\'t\\nfeel much like singing.\\n\\u3000He ran back down to the common room.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three\\nof us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --\"\\n\\u3000\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room.\\nNeville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad,\\nwho looked as though he\\'d been making another bid for freedom.\\n\\u3000\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\\nbehind his back.\\n\\u3000Neville stared at their guilty faces.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re going out again,\" he said.\\n\\u3000\"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we\\'re not. Why don\\'t you go to\\nbed, Neville?\"\\n\\u3000Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\\'t\\nafford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing\\nFluffy to sleep.\\n\\u3000\"You can\\'t go out,\" said Neville, \"you\\'ll be caught again. Gryffindor\\nwill be in even more trouble.\"\\n\\u3000\"You don\\'t understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\"\\n\\u3000But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\\n\\u3000I won\\'t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the\\nportrait hole. \"I\\'ll -- I\\'ll fight you!\"\\n\\u3000\"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don\\'t be an\\nidiot --\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. I don\\'t think you should\\nbe breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to\\nstand up to people!\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don\\'t\\nknow what you\\'re doing.\"\\n\\u3000He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who\\nleapt out of sight.\\n\\u3000\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I\\'m\\nready!\"\\n\\u3000Harry turned to Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"Do something,\" he said desperately.\\n\\u3000Hermione stepped forward.\\n\\u3000\"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\'m really, really sorry about this.\"\\n\\u3000She raised her wand.\\n\\u3000\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\n\\u3000Neville\\'s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His\\nwhole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his\\nface, stiff as a board.\\n\\u3000Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\'s jaws were jammed\\ntogether so he couldn\\'t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at\\nthem in horror.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'ve you done to him?\" Harry whispered.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I\\'m\\nso sorry.\"\\n\\u3000\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him\\nand pulled on the invisibility cloak.\\n\\u3000But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\'t feel like a\\nvery good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\'s shadow looked\\nlike Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping\\ndown on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.\\nNorris skulking near the top.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, let\\'s kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry\\'s ear, but\\nHarry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs.\\nNorris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\'t do anything.\\n\\u3000They didn\\'t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to\\nthe third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet\\nso that people would trip.\\n\\u3000\"Who\\'s there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\\nnarrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you\\'re there, even if I can\\'t see\\nyou. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\"\\n\\u3000He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\\n\\u3000\"Should call Filch, I should, if something\\'s a-creeping around\\nunseen.\"\\n\\u3000Harry had a sudden idea.\\n\\u3000\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his\\nown reasons for being invisible.\"\\n\\u3000Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time\\nand hovered about a foot off the stairs.\\n\\u3000\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My\\nmistake, my mistake -- I didn\\'t see you -- of course I didn\\'t, you\\'re\\ninvisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"\\n\\u3000\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this\\nplace tonight.\"\\n\\u3000\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air\\nagain. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\'ll not bother you.\"\\n\\u3000And he scooted off\\n\\u3000\"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\\n\\u3000A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor\\n-- and the door was already ajar.\\n\\u3000\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\'s already got past\\nFluffy.\"\\n\\u3000Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of\\nthem what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to\\nthe other two.\\n\\u3000\"If you want to go back, I won\\'t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take\\nthe cloak, I won\\'t need it now.\"\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t be stupid,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'re coming,\" said Hermione.\\n\\u3000Harry pushed the door open.\\n\\u3000As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three\\nof the dog\\'s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it\\ncouldn\\'t see them.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered.\\n\\u3000\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\\n\\u3000\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well,\\nhere goes...\"\\n\\u3000He put Hagrid\\'s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\'t really a tune, but\\nfrom the first note the beast\\'s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew\\nbreath. Slowly, the dog\\'s growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and\\nfell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\n\\u3000\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak\\nand crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\'s hot, smelly\\nbreath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we\\'ll be able to\\npull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog\\'s back. \"Want to go\\nfirst, Hermione?\"\\n\\u3000\"No, I don\\'t!\"\\n\\u3000\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\'s\\nlegs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and\\nopen.\\n\\u3000\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\\n\\u3000\"Nothing -- just black -- there\\'s no way of climbing down, we\\'ll just\\nhave to drop.\"\\n\\u3000Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his\\nattention and pointed at himself.\\n\\u3000\"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\'t know how\\ndeep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him\\nasleep.\"\\n\\u3000Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\' silence, the dog\\ngrowled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell\\nback into its deep sleep.\\n\\u3000Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There\\nwas no sign of the bottom.\\n\\u3000He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to\\nme, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\\nDumbledore, right?\"\\n\\u3000\"Right,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"See you in a minute, I hope...\\n\\u3000And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down,\\ndown, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he\\nlanded on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used\\nto the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,\\nwhich was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\"\\n\\u3000Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\\n\\u3000\"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words.\\n\\u3000\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\'s here to break the\\nfall. Come on, Hermione!\"\\n\\u3000The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\\'s other side.\\n\\u3000\"We must be miles under the school , she said.\\n\\u3000\"Lucky this plant thing\\'s here, really,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"\\n\\u3000She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist\\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their\\nnoticing.\\n\\u3000Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm\\ngrip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull\\nthe plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter\\nand faster the plant wound around them.\\n\\u3000\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it\\'s\\nDevil\\'s Snare!\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\"\\nsnarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling\\naround his neck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said\\nHermione.\\n\\u3000\"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as\\nit curled around his chest.\\n\\u3000\"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it\\nlikes the dark and the damp\\n\\u3000\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\\n\\u3000\"Yes -- of course -- but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing\\nher hands.\\n\\u3000\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR\\nNOT?\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved\\nit, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she\\nhad used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys\\nfelt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.\\nWriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they\\nwere able to pull free.\\n\\u3000\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\n\\u3000\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\'t lose his head in a crisis --\\n\\'there\\'s no wood,\\' honestly.\"\\n\\u3000\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which\\nwas the only way forward.\\n\\u3000All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\\nwater trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward,\\nand Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the\\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the\\nwizards\\' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert\\nhad been bad enough...\\n\\u3000\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\\n\\u3000Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming\\nfrom up ahead.\\n\\u3000\"Do you think it\\'s a ghost?\"\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t know... sounds like wings to me.\"\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"\\n\\u3000They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a\\nbrilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full\\nof small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the\\nroom. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\n\\u3000\"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose\\nif they all swooped down at once... well, there\\'s no other choice... I\\'ll\\nrun.\"\\n\\u3000He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\\nhim any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door\\nuntouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.\\n\\u3000The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door,\\nbut it wouldn\\'t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora\\ncharm.\\n\\u3000\"Now what?\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000\"These birds... they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said\\nHermione.\\n\\u3000They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?\\n\\u3000\"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'re keys! Winged keys\\n-- look carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber\\nwhile the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look!\\nBroomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\"\\n\\u3000\"But there are hundreds of them!\"\\n\\u3000Ron examined the lock on the door.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like\\nthe handle.\"\\n\\u3000They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring\\ninto the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but\\nthe bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost\\nimpossible to catch one.\\n\\u3000Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a\\ncentury. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\\'t. After\\na minute\\'s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he\\nnoticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already\\nbeen caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.\\n\\u3000\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there\\n-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\\n\\u3000Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed\\ninto the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above --\\nHermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and\\ncatch it. Right, NOW!\"\\n\\u3000Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both,\\nand Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned\\nforward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone\\nwith one hand. Ron and Hermione\\'s cheers echoed around the high\\nchamber.\\n\\u3000They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling\\nin his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The\\nmoment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking\\nvery battered now that it had been caught twice.\\n\\u3000\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle.\\nThey nodded. He pulled the door open.\\n\\u3000The next chamber was so dark they couldn\\'t see anything at all. But\\nas they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\\nastonishing sight.\\n\\u3000They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the\\nblack chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from\\nwhat looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber,\\nwere the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly --\\nthe towering white chessmen had no faces.\\n\\u3000\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across\\nthe room.\"\\n\\u3000Behind the white pieces they could see another door.\\n\\u3000\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\\n\\u3000\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\"\\n\\u3000He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\\nknight\\'s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the\\nground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight\\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\n\\u3000\"This needs thinking about he said. I suppose we\\'ve got to take the\\nplace of three of the black pieces....\"\\n\\u3000Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he\\nsaid, \"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that\\ngood at chess --\"\\n\\u3000\"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU\\n90 next to him instead of that castle.\"\\n\\u3000\"What about you?\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\\n\\u3000The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these\\nwords a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white\\npieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione took.\\n\\u3000\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the\\nboard. \"Yes... look...\"\\n\\u3000A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\\n\\u3000Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever\\nhe sent them. Harry\\'s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\\n\\u3000\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\\n\\u3000Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The\\nwhite queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board,\\nwhere he lay quite still, facedown.\\n\\u3000\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free\\nto take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\\n\\u3000Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no\\nmercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along\\nthe wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and\\nHermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking\\nalmost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.\\n\\u3000\"We\\'re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think let me\\nthink...\"\\n\\u3000The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\n\\u3000\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It\\'s the only way... I\\'ve got to be taken.\"\\n\\u3000\"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\'ve got to make some sacrifices! I\\ntake one step forward and she\\'ll take me -- that leaves you free to\\ncheckmate the king, Harry!\"\\n\\u3000\"But --\"\\n\\u3000\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\"\\n\\u3000\"Ron --\"\\n\\u3000\"Look, if you don\\'t hurry up, he\\'ll already have the Stone!\"\\n\\u3000There was no alternative.\\n\\u3000\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now,\\ndon\\'t hang around once you\\'ve won.\"\\n\\u3000He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron\\nhard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -\\nHermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen\\ndragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\\'d been knocked out.\\n\\u3000Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\n\\u3000The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\'s feet. They\\nhad won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead\\nclear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione\\ncharged through the door and up the next passageway.\\n\\u3000\"What if he\\'s --?\"\\n\\u3000\"He\\'ll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do\\nyou reckon\\'s next?\"\\n\\u3000\"We\\'ve had Sprout\\'s, that was the Devil\\'s Snare; Flitwick must\\'ve put\\ncharms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make\\nthem alive; that leaves Quirrell\\'s spell, and Snape\\'s.\"\\n\\u3000They had reached another door.\\n\\u3000\"All right?\" Harry whispered.\\n\\u3000\"Go on.\"\\n\\u3000Harry pushed it open.\\n\\u3000A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull\\ntheir robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the\\nfloor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had\\ntackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\'t\\nbreathe.\"\\n\\u3000He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at\\nwhat came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just\\na table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\\n\\u3000\"Snape\\'s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\\n\\u3000They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up\\nbehind them in the doorway. It wasn\\'t ordinary fire either; it was\\npurple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway\\nleading onward. They were trapped.\\n\\u3000\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.\\nHarry looked over her shoulder to read it:\\n\\u3000Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\\n\\u3000Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\\n\\u3000One among us seven will let you move ahead,\\n\\u3000Another will transport the drinker back instead,\\n\\u3000Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\\n\\u3000Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\\n\\u3000Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\\n\\u3000To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\\n\\u3000First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\\n\\u3000You will always find some on nettle wine\\'s left side;\\n\\u3000Second, different are those who stand at either end,\\n\\u3000But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\n\\u3000Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\\n\\u3000Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\\n\\u3000Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\\n\\u3000Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\\n\\u3000Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was\\nsmiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.\\n\\u3000\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn\\'t magic -- it\\'s logic -- a puzzle. A\\nlot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d be\\nstuck in here forever.\"\\n\\u3000\"But so will we, won\\'t we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione.\\n\"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are\\npoison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and\\none will get us back through the purple.\"\\n\\u3000\"But how do we know which to drink?\"\\n\\u3000\"Give me a minute.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and\\ndown the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At\\nlast, she clapped her hands.\\n\\u3000\"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black\\nfire -- toward the Stone.\"\\n\\u3000Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\\n\\u3000\"There\\'s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That\\'s hardly one\\nswallow.\"\\n\\u3000They looked at each other.\\n\\u3000\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"\\n\\u3000Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\n\\u3000\"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\\nbrooms from the flying- key room, they\\'ll get you out of the trapdoor\\nand past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to\\nDumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a\\nwhile, but I\\'m no match for him, really.\"\\n\\u3000\"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar.\\n\"I might get lucky again.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione\\'s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and\\nthrew her arms around him.\\n\\u3000\"Hermione!\"\\n\\u3000\"Harry -- you\\'re a great wizard, you know.\"\\n\\u3000\"I\\'m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go\\nof him.\\n\\u3000\"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more\\nimportant things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be\\ncareful!\"\\n\\u3000\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren\\'t\\nyou?\"\\n\\u3000\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round\\nbottle at the end, and shuddered.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\\n\\u3000\"No -- but it\\'s like ice.\"\\n\\u3000\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"\\n\\u3000\"Good luck -- take care.\"\\n\\u3000\"GO!\"\\n\\u3000Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\n\\u3000Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He\\nturned to face the black flames.\\n\\u3000\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\\n\\u3000It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\\ndown and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames\\nlicking his body, but couldn\\'t feel them -- for a moment he could see\\nnothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last\\nchamber.\\n\\u3000There was already someone there -- but it wasn\\'t Snape. It wasn\\'t\\neven Voldemort.\\n\\u3000\\n',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER SEVENTEEN: THE MAN WITH\\nTWO FACES\\n\\u3000It was Quirrell.\\n\\u3000\"You!\" gasped Harry.\\n\\u3000Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\\'t twitching at all.\\n\\u3000\"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\'d be meeting you here,\\nPotter.\"\\n\\u3000\"But I thought -- Snape --\"\\n\\u3000\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\'t his usual quivering treble,\\neither, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\'t\\nhe? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat.\\nNext to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor\\nQuirrell?\"\\n\\u3000Harry couldn\\'t take it in. This couldn\\'t be true, it couldn\\'t.\\n\\u3000\"But Snape tried to kill me!\"\\n\\u3000\"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger\\naccidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that\\nQuidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few\\nseconds and I\\'d have got you off that broom. I\\'d have managed it\\nbefore then if Snape hadn\\'t been muttering a countercurse, trying to\\nsave you.\"\\n\\u3000\"Snape was trying to save me?\"\\n\\u3000\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"\\\\Why do you think he wanted to\\nreferee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\'t do it\\nagain. Funny, really... he needn\\'t have bothered. I couldn\\'t do\\nanything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought\\nSnape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make\\nhimself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\'m\\ngoing to kill you tonight.\"\\n\\u3000Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and\\nwrapped themselves tightly around Harry.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\\nHalloween like that, for all I knew you\\'d seen me coming to look at\\nwhat was guarding the Stone.\"\\n\\u3000\"You let the troll in?\"\\n\\u3000\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen\\nwhat I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while\\neveryone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already\\nsuspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not\\nonly did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog\\ndidn\\'t even manage to bite Snape\\'s leg off properly.\\n\\u3000\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\\n\\u3000It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind\\nQuirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.\\n\\u3000\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured,\\ntapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up\\nwith something like this... but he\\'s in London... I\\'ll be far away by the\\ntime he gets back....\"\\n\\u3000All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop\\nhim from concentrating on the mirror.\\n\\u3000\"I saw you and Snape in the forest --\" he blurted out.\\n\\u3000\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the\\nback. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\'d got.\\nHe suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could,\\nwhen I had Lord Voldemort on my side....\"\\n\\u3000Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily\\ninto it.\\n\\u3000\"I see the Stone... I\\'m presenting it to my master... but where is it?\"\\n\\u3000Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\\'t give.\\nHe had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\n\\u3000\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at\\nHogwarts with your father, didn\\'t you know? They loathed each other.\\nBut he never wanted you dead.\"\\n\\u3000\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was\\nthreatening you....\"\\n\\u3000For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\\'s face.\\n\\u3000\"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master\\'s\\ninstructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --\"\\n\\u3000\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.\\n\\u3000\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him\\nwhen I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then,\\nfull of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed\\nme how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power,\\nand those too weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him\\nfaithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be\\nvery hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive\\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was\\nmost displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a\\ncloser watch on me....\"\\n\\u3000Quirrell\\'s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to\\nDiagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He\\'d seen Quirrell\\nthere that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\\u3000Quirrell cursed under his breath.\\n\\u3000\"I don\\'t understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break\\nit?\"\\n\\u3000Harry\\'s mind was racing.\\n\\u3000What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment,\\nhe thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the\\nmirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I\\'ll see where it\\'s\\nhidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\'m up to?\\n\\u3000He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without\\nQuirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he\\ntripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to\\nhimself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me,\\nMaster!\"\\n\\u3000And to Harry\\'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to\\ncome from Quirrell himself\\n\\u3000\"Use the boy... Use the boy...\"\\n\\u3000Quirrell rounded on Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Yes -- Potter -- come here.\"\\n\\u3000He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off.\\nHarry got slowly to his feet.\\n\\u3000\"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me\\nwhat you see.\"\\n\\u3000Harry walked toward him.\\n\\u3000I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I\\nsee, that\\'s all.\\n\\u3000Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell\\nthat seemed to come from Quirrell\\'s turban. He closed his eyes,\\nstepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.\\n\\u3000He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\\nlater, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and\\npulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its\\npocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his\\nreal pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he\\'d gotten the Stone.\\n\\u3000\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"\\n\\u3000Harry screwed up his courage.\\n\\u3000\"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I -- I\\'ve\\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.\"\\n\\u3000Quirrell cursed again.\\n\\u3000\"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\\nSorcerer\\'s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\n\\u3000But he hadn\\'t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\\nQuirrell wasn\\'t moving his lips.\\n\\u3000\"He lies... He lies...\"\\n\\u3000\"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What\\ndid you just see?\"\\n\\u3000The high voice spoke again.\\n\\u3000\"Let me speak to him... face-to-face...\"\\n\\u3000\"Master, you are not strong enough!\"\\n\\u3000\"I have strength enough... for this....\"\\n\\u3000Harry felt as if Devil\\'s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He\\ncouldn\\'t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up\\nand began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell\\naway. Quirrell\\'s head looked strangely small without it. Then he\\nturned slowly on the spot.\\n\\u3000Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\\'t make a sound. Where\\nthere should have been a back to Quirrell\\'s head, there was a face, the\\nmost terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring\\nred eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.\\n\\u3000\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.\\n\\u3000Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\'t move.\\n\\u3000\"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor ...\\nI have form only when I can share another\\'s body... but there have\\nalways been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds....\\nUnicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw\\nfaithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the\\nElixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why\\ndon\\'t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\"\\n\\u3000So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\'s legs. He\\nstumbled backward.\\n\\u3000\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and\\njoin me... or you\\'ll meet the same end as your parents.... They died\\nbegging me for mercy...\"\\n\\u3000\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.\\n\\u3000Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still\\nsee him. The evil face was now smiling.\\n\\u3000\"How touching...\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your\\nparents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a\\ncourageous fight... but your mother needn\\'t have died... she was trying\\nto protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have\\ndied in vain.\"\\n\\u3000\"NEVER!\"\\n\\u3000Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed\\n\"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\'s hand close on\\nhis wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\\'s scar; his\\nhead felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling\\nwith all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain\\nin his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell\\nhad gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they\\nwere blistering before his eyes.\\n\\u3000\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\\nlunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet\\' landing on top of him, both\\nhands around Harry\\'s neck -- Harry\\'s scar was almost blinding him\\nwith pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.\\n\\u3000\"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!\"\\n\\u3000And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees,\\nlet go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry\\ncould see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\n\\u3000\"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort.\\n\\u3000Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by\\ninstinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face --\\n\\u3000\"AAAARGH!\"\\n\\u3000Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry\\nknew: Quirrell couldn\\'t touch his bare skin, not without suffering\\nterrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him\\nin enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.\\n\\u3000Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on\\nas tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off --\\nthe pain in Harry\\'s head was building -- he couldn\\'t see -- he could\\nonly hear Quirrell\\'s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\'s yells of, \"KILL\\nHIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\'s own head,\\ncrying, \"Harry! Harry!\"\\n\\u3000He felt Quirrell\\'s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost,\\nand fell into blackness, down ... down... down...\\n\\u3000Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to\\ncatch it, but his arms were too heavy.\\n\\u3000He blinked. It wasn\\'t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\\nstrange.\\n\\u3000He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\\nview above him.\\n\\u3000\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him.\\nThen he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the\\nStone! Sir, quick --\"\\n\\u3000\"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said\\nDumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\"\\n\\u3000\"Then who does? Sir, I --\"\\n\\u3000\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\\n\\u3000Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in\\nthe hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and\\nnext to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the\\ncandy shop.\\n\\u3000\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore,\\nbeaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and\\nProfessor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school\\nknows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were\\nresponsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought\\nit would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be\\nvery hygienic, and confiscated it.\"\\n\\u3000\"How long have I been in here?\"\\n\\u3000\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\\nrelieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\\n\\u3000\"But sit, the Stone\\n\\u3000I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to\\nprevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must\\nsay.\\n\\u3000\"You got there? You got Hermione\\'s owl?\"\\n\\u3000\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London\\nthan it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I\\nhad just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"\\n\\u3000\"It was you.\"\\n\\u3000\"I feared I might be too late.\"\\n\\u3000\"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much\\nlonger --\"\\n\\u3000\"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For\\none terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has\\nbeen destroyed.\"\\n\\u3000\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel\\n--\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite\\ndelighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas\\nand I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\"\\n\\u3000\"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\"\\n\\u3000\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and\\nthen, yes, they will die.\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\'s face.\\n\\u3000\"To one as young as you, I\\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas\\nand Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day.\\nAfter all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great\\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful\\nthing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things\\nmost human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans\\ndo have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\\nthem.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little\\nand smiled at the ceiling.\\n\\u3000\"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone\\'s gone,\\nVol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --\"\\n\\u3000\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things.\\nFear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back,\\nisn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\"\\n\\u3000\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps\\nlooking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be\\nkilled. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his\\nfollowers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only\\nhave delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else\\nwho is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if\\nhe is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\"\\n\\u3000Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt.\\nThen he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you\\ncan tell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"\\n\\u3000\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing,\\nand should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall\\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in\\nwhich case I beg you\\'ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"\\n\\u3000\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she\\ntried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in\\nthe first place?\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\n\\u3000\"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not\\nnow. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.\\nWhen you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are\\nready, you will know.\"\\n\\u3000And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\n\\u3000\"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\"\\n\\u3000\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort\\ncannot understand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as\\nyour mother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible\\nsign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who\\nloved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your\\nvery skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his\\nsoul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony\\nto touch a person marked by something so good.\"\\n\\u3000Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the\\nwindowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When\\nhe had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak -\\ndo you know who sent it to me?\"\\n\\u3000\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I\\nthought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful\\nthings... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to\\nsteal food when he was here.\"\\n\\u3000\"And there\\'s something else...\"\\n\\u3000\"Fire away.\"\\n\\u3000\"Quirrell said Snape --\"\\n\\u3000\"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me\\nbecause he hated my father. Is that true?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never\\nforgive.\"\\n\\u3000\"What?\"\\n\\u3000\"He saved his life.\"\\n\\u3000\"What?\"\\n\\u3000\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds\\nwork, isn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s\\ndebt.... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year\\nbecause he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he\\ncould go back to hating your father\\'s memory in peace....\"\\n\\u3000Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he\\nstopped.\\n\\u3000\"And sir, there\\'s one more thing...\"\\n\\u3000\"Just the one?\"\\n\\u3000\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"\\n\\u3000\"Ah, now, I\\'m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more\\nbrilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something. You\\nsee, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it --\\nwould be able to get it, otherwise they\\'d just see themselves making\\ngold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me\\nsometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on\\nthese sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate\\nenough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since\\nthen I\\'m afraid I\\'ve rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I\\'ll be\\nsafe with a nice toffee, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\u3000He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then\\nhe choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"\\n\\u3000Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\n\\u3000\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.\\n\\u3000\"Absolutely not.\"\\n\\u3000\"You let Professor Dumbledore in...\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need\\nrest.\"\\n\\u3000\"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\nPomfrey...\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\"\\n\\u3000And she let Ron and Hermione in.\\n\\u3000\"Harry!\"\\n\\u3000Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but\\nHarry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so\\nworried --\"\\n\\u3000\"The whole school\\'s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really\\nhappened?\"\\n\\u3000It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them\\neverything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and\\nHermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right\\nplaces, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\\'s turban,\\nHermione screamed out loud.\\n\\u3000\"So the Stone\\'s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\'s just going to die?\"\\n\\u3000\"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- \\'to\\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\n\\u3000\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite\\nimpressed at how crazy his hero was.\\n\\u3000\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round --\\nthat took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew\\n-- he just said, \\'Harry\\'s gone after him, hasn\\'t he?\\' and hurtled off to\\nthe third floor.\"\\n\\u3000\"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your\\nfather\\'s cloak and everything?\"\\n\\u3000\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that\\'s terrible\\n-- you could have been killed.\"\\n\\u3000\"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man,\\nDumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he\\nknows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon\\nhe had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of\\nstopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an\\naccident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he\\nthought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could....\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly.\\n\"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The\\npoints are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last\\nQuidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you --\\nbut the food\\'ll be good.\"\\n\\u3000At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\n\\u3000\"You\\'ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.\\n\\u3000After a good night\\'s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\n\\u3000I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she\\nstraightened his many candy boxes. I can, can\\'t I?\"\\n\\u3000\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said\\nstiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize\\nhow risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to\\nHarry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands. I\\ntold the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only\\nthing he didn\\'t know, an\\' I told him! Yeh could\\'ve died! All fer a\\ndragon egg! I\\'ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\' made\\nter live as a Muggle!\"\\n\\u3000\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have\\nfound out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have\\nfound out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\"\\n\\u3000\"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\"\\n\\u3000\"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he\\nstopped crying. \"I\\'ve met him and I\\'m calling him by his name. Please\\ncheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\'s gone, he can\\'t use it. Have a\\nChocolate Frog, I\\'ve got loads....\"\\n\\u3000Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That\\nreminds me. I\\'ve got yeh a present.\"\\n\\u3000\"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last\\nHagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off\\nyesterday ter fix it. \\'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway,\\ngot yeh this...\"\\n\\u3000It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\\ncuriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at\\nhim from every page were his mother and father.\\n\\u3000\"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer\\nphotos... knew yeh didn\\' have any... d\\'yeh like it?\"\\n\\u3000Harry couldn\\'t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\n\\u3000Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.\\nHe had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\\'s fussing about, insisting on\\ngiving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was\\ndecked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate\\nSlytherin\\'s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A\\nhuge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind\\nthe High Table.\\n\\u3000When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then\\neverybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat\\nbetween Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore\\nthe fact that people were standing up to look at him.\\n\\u3000Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died\\naway.\\n\\u3000\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must\\ntrouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our\\nteeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your\\nheads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole\\nsummer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts....\\n\\u3000\"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and\\nthe points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred\\nand twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-\\ntwo; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four\\nhundred and seventy- two.\"\\n\\u3000A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin\\ntable. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It\\nwas a sickening sight.\\n\\u3000\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\\nevents must be taken into account.\"\\n\\u3000The room went very still. The Slytherins\\' smiles faded a little.\\n\\u3000\"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish\\nout. Let me see. Yes...\\n\\u3000\"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\\n\\u3000Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad\\nsunburn.\\n\\u3000\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many\\nyears, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\n\\u3000Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars\\noverhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other\\nprefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past\\nMcGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\"\\n\\u3000At last there was silence again.\\n\\u3000\"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in\\nthe face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\\n\\u3000Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she\\nhad burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside\\nthemselves -- they were a hundred points up. \"Third -- to Mr. Harry\\nPotter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve\\nand outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\"\\n\\u3000The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\\nthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and\\nseventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for\\nthe house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more\\npoint.\\n\\u3000Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\n\\u3000\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes\\na great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to\\nstand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville\\nLongbottom.\"\\n\\u3000Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought\\nsome sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that\\nerupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up\\nto yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a\\npile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for\\nGryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and\\npointed at Malfoy, who couldn\\'t have looked more stunned and\\nhorrified if he\\'d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\n\\u3000\"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for\\neven Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of\\nSlytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\"\\n\\u3000He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became\\nscarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent\\nvanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was\\nshaking Professor McGonagall\\'s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He\\ncaught Harry\\'s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\\'s feelings\\ntoward him hadn\\'t changed one jot. This didn\\'t worry Harry. It seemed\\nas though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it\\never was at Hogwarts.\\n\\u3000It was the best evening of Harry\\'s life, better than winning at\\nQuidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would\\nnever, ever forget tonight.\\n\\u3000Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come,\\nbut come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed\\nwith good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first\\nyears. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making\\nup for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was\\nalmost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had\\npassed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\'t have\\neverything in life.\\n\\u3000And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were\\npacked, Neville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets;\\nnotes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic\\nover the holidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said\\nFred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet\\nof boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts\\nExpress; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and\\ntidier; eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle\\ntowns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;\\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station.\\n\\u3000It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened\\nold guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the\\ngate in twos and threes so they didn\\'t attract attention by all bursting\\nout of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.\\n\\u3000\"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you -- I\\'ll\\nsend you an owl.\"\\n\\u3000\"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\"\\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back\\nto the Muggle world. Some of them called:\\n\\u3000\"Bye, Harry!\"\\n\\u3000\"See you, Potter!\"\\n\\u3000\"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him.\\n\\u3000\"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry.\\n\\u3000He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together.\\n\"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\"\\n\\u3000It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s younger sister, but she wasn\\'t pointing\\nat Ron.\\n\\u3000\"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see\\n\\u3000\"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\"\\n\\u3000Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.\\n\\u3000\"Busy year?\" she said.\\n\\u3000\"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.\\nWeasley.\"\\n\\u3000\"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\"\\n\\u3000\"Ready, are you?\"\\n\\u3000It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station\\nfull of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,\\nlooking terrified at the very sight of Harry.\\n\\u3000\"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\u3000\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we\\nhaven\\'t got all day.\" He walked away.\\n\\u3000Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\n\\u3000\"See you over the summer, then.\"\\n\\u3000\"Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking\\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so\\nunpleasant.\\n\\u3000\"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was\\nspreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use\\nmagic at home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this\\nsummer....\"\\n\\u3000THE END\\n']"

The chapter sets the tone for the larger narrative by revealing the magical and mysterious events unfolding in the when a Muggle (non-magical) with no magical connections, finds themselves inadvertently entwined with the world of magic. This first chapter primarily focuses on the introduction of the Dursleys, and does not feature substantial developments in the plot outside of foreshadowing the obstacles Harry Potter will face as he comes to terms with his magical heritage. Although the Dursleys initially try to avoid anything related to magic, they are unknowingly central to the plot as they become Harry's initial guardians.\n",

       "['Chapter 1: The Two Worlds \\n\\nParth Jadeja leaned back in his chair, the glow of the monitor illuminating his face in the dimly lit room. His gaming setup—a mechanical keyboard, a high-refresh-rate monitor, and a headset resting on his shoulders—was his escape. For years, virtual battlegrounds had been his second home, a place where he mastered reflexes, strategy, and teamwork. But lately, another world has been demanding his attention—the world of AI and machine learning. \\nBy day, he was a final-year Computer Engineering student specializing in AI/ML, dissecting algorithms, optimizing code, and diving into research papers. By night, he was R2K DESMOND, his Riot ID in Valorant, a competitor in the ever-evolving gaming realm. The two sides of his life coexisted in a delicate balance, but he knew the scale was beginning to tip. \\nHis desk was a reflection of this dual existence—on one side, stacks of books on reinforcement learning, speech processing, and SEO strategies; on the other, an RGB-lit gaming rig, a testament to years of dedication to competitive gaming. His mind constantly toggled between debugging errors and devising new game strategies, between career ambitions and the thrill of virtual victories. \\nBut a bigger decision loomed on the horizon. With graduation approaching, he needed to make a choice—pursue a stable career in AI, SEO, and prompt engineering, or take a riskier path, one that would merge his passion for gaming with his technical skills. The uncertainty was thrilling, yet terrifying. \\nOne evening, as he was deep in an SEO research project, a notification popped up on his phone. A message from a gaming community he had long admired—an invitation to work on an AI-driven project that aimed to revolutionize gaming analytics. It was the kind of opportunity that blurred the line between his two worlds. \\nParth took a deep breath, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. Was this the bridge he had been looking for? Or just another distraction pulling him away from the conventional path? \\nThe decision he was about to make would define the next chapter of his life.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 2: The Leap \\n\\nThe cursor blinked as Parth hesitated. His mind raced through possible outcomes—accepting the offer could mean stepping into uncharted territory, blending his passion for gaming with AI, but declining meant following the safer, more conventional path. \\nFinally, with a deep breath, he typed his response:  \"I\\'m interested. Tell me more.\"  He hit send and leaned back, waiting for a reply that could potentially change his life. \\nThe response came within minutes. The project was an ambitious one—an AI-driven system that analyzed players\\' in-game performances, offering real-time insights to improve strategies. The team consisted of engineers, data scientists, and pro gamers, all working towards a vision of merging AI with esports. \\nExcitement bubbled within him. This was exactly the kind of challenge he had been searching for. But the commitment required was intense—late-night meetings, rigorous testing, and the pressure to deliver something groundbreaking. \\nAs he weighed his options, his phone buzzed again—this time, an email from a recruiter regarding an SEO Executive position at a firm in Ahmedabad. The position promised stability, career growth, and a structured path forward. \\nParth sighed. Two paths lay before him: one filled with adventure and uncertainty, the other with predictability and security. For the first time in his life, the gamer in him felt like he was truly playing for high stakes. \\nHe had a decision to make, and time was running out.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 3: The Crossroads \\n\\nThe night was silent, save for the rhythmic hum of his PC. Parth stared at the two open windows on his screen—one displaying the AI-driven gaming project’s proposal, the other the job offer email. His fingers tapped absently on the desk as he weighed the pros and cons. \\nHe opened a new tab and instinctively searched for success stories—people who had blended AI with gaming, who had created something revolutionary. Some names popped up, their journeys inspiring, but there were just as many cautionary tales of ambitious projects that had failed to take off. \\nIs this worth the risk?  he thought. He looked around his room, eyes landing on a framed picture from his childhood—him and his brother playing on an old console, lost in the virtual world. Gaming had always been a part of his life, but was it meant to be his future? \\nThen, a new email arrived. \\nSubject:  Follow-up on Your Application - SEO Executive Role \\nThe company was scheduling interviews and wanted to know his availability. The safety net was right there, waiting for him to take it. \\nParth exhaled sharply. He had always played his games with calculated risks—aggressive but methodical. Maybe that was the way to approach this decision too. \\nHe picked up his phone and messaged a friend who worked in the gaming industry.  \"Got a minute? Need some advice.\" \\nA few seconds later, the reply came:  \"Always. Call me.\" \\nHe swiped to the call button and pressed it. It was time to stop overthinking and start taking action.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 4: The Decision \\n\\nParth listened intently as Preet, his gaming industry friend, laid out the pros and cons of both paths. He had expected a straightforward answer, but instead, Preet proposed something different—a hybrid approach. \\n“Do both,” Preet had said. “Secure your future, but don’t give up on your passion just yet. See where the gaming AI project goes. If it takes off, you can pivot. If not, you’ve still got a career.” \\nThat advice stuck with him. The next day, Parth accepted the SEO job while also committing part-time to the gaming project. It was a gruelling schedule, but he knew it was the best way forward.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 5: The Final Choice \\n\\nMonths passed in a blur of deadlines, late-night coding sessions, and back-to-back meetings. The SEO job was challenging yet rewarding; he quickly adapted, improving website rankings and learning new strategies. Meanwhile, the AI gaming project was slowly taking shape, with promising results from early testing. \\nBut exhaustion crept in. The dual commitment was stretching him thin, and he realized something had to give. The gaming project was gaining momentum, attracting investors and interest from esports teams. It was becoming more than just a side gig—it had the potential to be a full-fledged career. \\nOne evening, after yet another sleepless night juggling both roles, he knew it was time. \\nWith conviction, he submitted his resignation from the SEO job, thanking his mentors for the experience. He had learned valuable skills, but his heart was in the AI-driven gaming project. It wasn’t just passion—it was where he saw his future. \\nAs he powered up his gaming rig, now not just for play but for creation, he smiled. The road ahead was uncertain, but he was finally all in. \\nAnd for the first time in a long while, everything felt right.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 6: A New Game Begins \\n\\nParth Jadeja had taken the leap. The AI-driven gaming analytics project was no longer just an experiment—it had transformed into a full-fledged startup. Investors were onboard, esports teams were intrigued, and his schedule was packed with strategy meetings, product development sprints, and late-night brainstorming sessions. \\nYet, amid the professional whirlwind, his life outside work was shifting as well. His parents, once skeptical of his unconventional career path, had started seeing the value in his decisions. They still worried—\"Why not a stable corporate job?\" his mother would ask—but seeing his passion materialize into something tangible reassured them. \\nHis relationship with friends also evolved. Preet, the industry friend who had advised him, became his mentor, guiding him through business strategies and professional networking. His gaming friends now saw him less as a competitor and more as a pioneer, someone who had crossed into the realm of game development while staying true to his roots. \\nDespite the success, challenges loomed. Investors wanted faster results, competitors were catching up, and the pressure to innovate weighed heavily. The thrill of the startup world was exhilarating, but it also demanded resilience. Would he be able to keep up?  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 7: Balancing the Worlds \\n\\nWith his career taking off, balancing work and personal life became an art. Family dinners were often interrupted by urgent emails, and gaming sessions were no longer just for fun—they were research. The lines between work and passion blurred. \\nHowever, he refused to let go of the people who mattered. He made it a point to visit his parents every weekend, listening to their stories and assuring them he was doing fine. His brother, now watching his journey closely, often joked, \"You’ve gone from grinding in Valorant to grinding in real life.\" \\nHis social circle expanded beyond gaming and tech. Industry professionals, esports analysts, and even startup founders became part of his network. Yet, among all the new faces, he valued the old friendships the most. His college friends—some working corporate jobs, others chasing dreams like him—remained his grounding force. \\nAs he sat in his dimly lit room, a cup of coffee in hand, he wondered:  Could he keep up with this lifestyle without burning out?  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 8: The Price of Success \\n\\nWith every milestone reached, the stakes grew higher. The AI-powered gaming analytics tool had launched its beta version, and feedback was pouring in. Esports teams found it promising, but critics pointed out its flaws. The pressure mounted, and with it came sleepless nights, stress, and self-doubt. \\nThe success didn’t come without sacrifices. Late-night work sessions meant missed family events. Friends started noticing his absence. \"You never show up anymore,\" one of them texted. His health took a hit—fast food replaced home-cooked meals, and workouts became rare. He had traded one kind of grind for another. \\nOne evening, exhausted, he stared at his reflection in the monitor’s dark screen. Was this what he had envisioned? Had he taken on too much? \\nIt was time to reevaluate. He needed to regain balance.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 9: Redefining the Game Plan \\n\\nParth made a decision—he wouldn’t let his passion become a burden. He restructured his schedule, delegated tasks, and learned to say no to non-essential work. He reconnected with friends, made time for his family, and started focusing on his health again. \\nSlowly, he found a rhythm. The startup continued growing, but now with a more sustainable approach. Investors noticed the improvement, his team felt more aligned, and his personal life wasn’t just an afterthought. \\nHis mentality had shifted. The boy who once hesitated between two paths had now built his own.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 10: A Future Unwritten \\n\\nStanding at the crossroads once again, Parth knew his journey was far from over. His startup had secured its first major client, and expansion opportunities were on the horizon. He was no longer just a gamer or an engineer—he was an innovator, a leader. \\nBut most importantly, he had learned that success wasn’t just about choosing the right path—it was about adapting, evolving, and knowing when to pause and reset. \\nAs he powered up his laptop for another day, he smiled. The next chapter of his life was unwritten, but he was ready to script it—one pixel, one algorithm at a time.  \\n',\n",
       " \"Chapter 11: Lexie - The Unexpected Connection \\n\\nParth Jadeja had always believed in logic, patterns, and well-structured plans. But love, much like an unpredictable algorithm, had its own way of manifesting. He met Lexie in the most unexpected way—an online gaming tournament. What started as casual conversations over voice chat soon turned into a deep connection. She wasn't just another gamer; she was a strategist, a thinker, and someone who challenged his perspectives. \\nTheir relationship developed through shared victories and late-night discussions on everything from AI models to game mechanics. Lexie, a software engineer with an inclination toward ethical AI, resonated with Parth’s ambitions. She saw beyond his career-driven mindset and into the person who sometimes doubted his own path.  \\n\",\n",
       " 'Chapter 12: The Foundation of Trust \\n\\nUnlike his career, which thrived on calculated risks, love required vulnerability—something Parth wasn’t always comfortable with. Lexie, however, had a way of making him feel at ease. She understood his drive and passion but also reminded him to take breaks, to live beyond his codes and gaming strategies. \\nTheir bond was built on trust, patience, and mutual respect. They challenged each other intellectually and emotionally, never shying away from difficult conversations. Parth found in Lexie a balance—where he was intense, she was calm; where he was over-analytical, she brought warmth and spontaneity.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 13: Love and Career - A Parallel Journey \\n\\nAs Parth’s AI gaming analytics venture grew, so did their relationship. They navigated time zones, deadlines, and personal growth together. Lexie, who worked on ethical AI solutions, often provided insights into his projects, making them more user-friendly and inclusive. \\nYet, they faced their share of challenges. Parth’s work often demanded long hours, and Lexie’s career had its own set of pressures. But they learned to communicate, to make time for each other despite their demanding schedules. Weekend getaways, gaming marathons, and unplanned coffee shop dates became their way of staying connected.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 14: The Moment of Realization \\n\\nParth had always envisioned success as building a thriving business, but Lexie made him realize that personal fulfillment was just as important. One evening, as they sat overlooking the city skyline, she asked, “When was the last time you did something just for yourself—not for work, not for growth, just for fun?” \\nThat question lingered with him. She wasn’t asking him to change but to evolve, to see life beyond the race for success. It was in that moment that Parth truly understood love wasn’t about grand gestures but about the small, consistent efforts that made life meaningful.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Chapter 15: The Future, Together \\n\\nAs they built their respective careers, they also built a future together. Talks of collaboration on AI-driven gaming ethics projects turned into discussions about life goals. \\nThey knew challenges lay ahead—balancing careers, responsibilities, and personal aspirations. But for Parth, love was no longer an equation to solve; it was an experience to embrace. And with Lexie by his side, he felt ready to face whatever came next. \\nBecause in the end, just like in gaming and AI, the best strategies are those played with the right teammate \\n\\n\\n']"
